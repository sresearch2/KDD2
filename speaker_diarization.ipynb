      "SPEAKER_01:you very much.Chair Jerome Powell wrapping up his first press conference of the year. Let's take a look at how the markets are reacting to this and still holding on to gains, despite the fact that Fed Chair Powell reiterated time and time again that more increases would be necessary in order to get inflation under control. You're looking at the Dow up 45 points, flipping back into positive territory during that press conference. S &P up just about 1%. The Nasdaq now up nearly 2%. Dave, in all this coming time and time again, Fed Chair Jay Powell saying that the risk here is just about doing too little rather than doing too much and saying that more increases are certainly necessary at this time.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Largely speaking, very similar to prior speeches, almost word for word. As he just reiterated there, they have taken COVID out. They no longer think it is a serious impact on the economy, with the exception of that. And saying, really making clear that they have to raise the debt ceiling. This is largely the same speech we have heard going back a couple of Fed meetings now. And look, this is an economic Rorschach test. The markets see what they want to see, and they see a butterfly in that speech. I think a lot of people might see a bat. I hear what you heard, that it sounds in all likelihood, although he punted, largely speaking, on keeping in the language of ongoing increase. He was asked twice. To confirm if that meant multiple increases are still coming after this 25 point hike, which by the way is the eighth in the last year. He punted twice on saying whether or not there would be multiple coming. I don't know what to you is raising. Let's just look at the NASDAQ. Most sensitive to interest rates. What to you is justifying a 2 % increase?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think that he left the door open. He wasn't committal just in terms of how a graph is going to change. He was saying that the Fed is going to get a lot more aggressive than the Fed was going to get. And this is like you were saying, certainly similar to what we've seen in the last couple of Fed decisions, the last couple of conferences. The markets hear what they want to hear, and they hang on to any sort of optimism. And we're seeing that playing out in the markets again today. Some comments about the jobs market really stuck out to me just in terms of what exactly needs to happen. Powell saying that the labor market is still extremely tight. And he was saying that there are some signs of improvement that labor cost reports. That we got out earlier this week. He called that quote constructive. But he did remain the fact that maybe we could see improvement\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:inflation, inflation easing without massive destruction here in the labor market. Something he's reiterated time and time again.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:the flip side of what you're seeing in the markets, this stands out to me. We will need substantially more evidence to begin cutting. Substantially more evidence. He added the risk to them. And he has reiterated this for several meetings now. So, we have to think about this. And I'm going to turn it over to Jerome Powell. Jerome Powell is doing too little. And he's been very clear. They'd rather overdo it than underdo it when it comes to these increases. A lot of work left to do. And we don't see disinflation in that services ex -housing sector. And that is why they will continue to hike. And look, sounds to me, to one person, like there are two more increases. But the markets don't hear that.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:The markets don't hear that. They don't want to hear that. Powell is saying that the global picture is improving a bit. Inflation comes down. Sentiment, he says, is going to improve.\n",
      "ttJlbPchk5Q.mp4\n",
      "\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:think from a contrarian basis, if you're looking for names that the market has hated, but maybe have a big theme around it, we love the communications services sector from a thematic perspective in terms of, we call it the three Cs of communication services, catch, content, and consolidation. I think the streamers are going to consolidate. Who could consolidate? Who could be the winner?Well, listen, you know, I like not, not unlike all other Americans, I get like 10 streaming services is too much, right? So the winner in the one that we've stayed with all along and received a lot of negative press about it is Netflix. I think Netflix is the Kleenex of streaming, bottom line, period. Best run, cashflow, now they're going to the advertising. Fantastic. They will be the core, right? I think Disney is going to be part of the core. What happens to Peacock and Paramount Plus and all of these others, I think remains to be seen. And so I think that's where you want to look. With respect to potential consolidation, especially given the fact that the content is becoming much more, much more expensive in the streams and how we're going to deliver that content. Netflix has got it right.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:Jared, what are we seeing? Instantly they didn't like it and now coming back to earth? Yeah, so it looks like a little green here. Not a lot, but we'll take it. And actually the fireworks start in just a few minutes here, about 14 or so. So here's the NASDAQ and you can see here is a 2 p .m. announcement. Initially we went down, now we're back up. A lot of times there are zigzags, including when Chair Powell takes the lectern at 2 .30. What matters today is not only the close today, but also the close tomorrow. So you take yesterday's, that would be Tuesday's close. You compared it to tomorrow's close. If it's higher, well, that is a successful FOMC announcement, not necessarily from the perspective of the Fed, but from the average investor. Now let's take a look at the sector action. Only tech in the forefront there. Notable because that has been a leading sector this year and one of the worst off last year. And that kind of speaks to that paradigm that we've had where the NASDAQ is leading this year, leading the Dow, and it was the opposite last year. Energy taking up the rear there. But let's check out what's going on. We're seeing a lot of movement in the bond market. And not seeing a whole lot of movement here either. This is a 10 -year Treasury note. Futures basically where we were when we started the announcement. So I would expect that to pick up some steam when Powell takes some questions later on. And let's get to some other markets here, some other leading markets, especially in the futures. Let's take a look at gold. Gold really not moving. Now, gold has been on a little bit of a tear so far. It's up 5 .5 % year to date compared to where it's been over the last year. Really regaining some of that lost territory. Copper futures, let me put this back to an intraday. Not seeing a whole lot of movement from Dr. Copper right there. And we got to check out Bitcoin. Bitcoin, very telling. I've been saying you want to know where the stocks are going to close. Watch where Bitcoin is moving into that press conference. And it looks very squiggly right here. That's because this is a very small range for Bitcoin. Let me put a year -to -date chart here. And you can just see what I'm talking about. It's pretty much flatlined over the last week to ten days. So if Bitcoin is moving, it's going to be a little bit of a tear. If Bitcoin starts moving up in a big way, it could be a leading indicator. Down the same way. Don't have much more than that. We look into these statements and we look into the charts with quite the colored eye here, Dave. It's really hanging on though, Bitcoin. Really just - Above 23 ,000 still. Above 20 ,000. Can't complain.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:afternoon. Rate hike the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark policy rate by a quarter percentage point to a new range of four and a half to four and three quarters percent. That marks the highest level since October 2007. Now in their statement, Fed officials acknowledged that inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated. They no longer noted, however, that the war in Ukraine is contributing upward pressure to inflation, rather just global uncertainty. Now they did maintain language in the statement that quote ongoing increases in rate hikes would be appropriate to obtain a quote sufficiently restrictive level on the Fed funds rate, perhaps in effect countering that recent easing in financial conditions. Now the Fed also noted that in termining the quote the extent of future rate hikes instead of pace, which was formally used in the former statement, that the Fed will take into account lags and monetary policy and the impact of that. On inflation, the economy and financial developments. Of course, this move marking a further slowdown from the 50 basis point rate hike we saw in December and a further slowdown from a string of 475 basis point rate hikes in June through November of last year, which was the most aggressive stretch since the 1980s. This decision was unanimous. We will get more from Fed Chair Powell when he holds its press conference in less than 30 minutes time. Back to you.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Thank you. And when we take a look at this, you mentioned the fact that ongoing rate increases, they remain appropriate. Inflation, though, has eased somewhat. We know a lot of the focus is going to be on Powell, what he says, the tone that he is using. What will you be looking to hear from Powell in just about 30 minutes from now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:expect that Chair Powell to take a very hawkish tone. He is going to remain committed to bringing down inflation to 2%. While it has eased over the past three months, it still remains well -informed. The Fed's 2 % target, if you look at the Fed's preferred measure on inflation, that so -called core PCE, clocked in around 4 .4 % in December. So still somewhat elevated there. So I expect him to talk tough on inflation. And especially if financial conditions remain easy or ease further, I think that could give the Fed license to continue raising at that point. And that's why I think you saw the Fed maintain language for ongoing increases, plural.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:decades of sales and over 200 billion dollars in revenue, America's best -selling drug is finally going generic. Injectable arthritis and autoimmune treatment Humira has lost its monopoly. So what does this mean for competitors and overall costs? AbbVie Finance's Anjali Kemlani is following the story. Hi Anjali.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Hi Rochelle. So as you mentioned this is AbbVie's top -selling drug, absolute blockbuster that treats rheumatoid arthritis specifically as well as some other diseases. And so what we're looking at is the drop -off of the exclusivity of that patent for AbbVie and Amgen is coming on with its own biosimilar. There are also a number of others expected this year now this is not new the part that we know is that you know these biosimilars have been ready to go but what AbbVie did really is extend its patent for this drug an additional six years from 2016 when it was supposed to be a pharmacogenetic patent and it was supposed to be a to lose exclusivity and when the biosimilars were supposed to get on. Now, let me introduce you to Aviz Humira, and that is a drug that has, as you mentioned, $208 billion since getting on the market in 2002, $114 billion since 2016 when it renewed that patent, and $20 billion alone in 2022. So that's the market there that they are now competing with another treatment on the market with Amgen. Now, Amgen is doing something really interesting, and that is pricing its biosimilar at two different levels, 5 % and 55 % off of Humira's price. Now, why that's interesting is because, as we know, the U .S. drug system relies heavily on PBMs and insurers to take up the control of who gets these drugs, how the formularies work. And what that means is that there's an incentive for the higher list price to be the one that's used. Now, two things. One is that there's an incentive for the higher list price to be the one that's used. So, for example, two insurers, Cigna and United Healthcare, have already kind of taken a stab at this by pointing to the fact that they're going to have both Aviz drug and the biosimilars on the same tier in the formulary, meaning that it's going to be the same out -of -pocket cost for patients. However, what actually ends up getting prescribed is going to be particularly interesting when we see what the individual's particular insurance plan is, what their out -of -pocket costs are going to be, et cetera. So, really interesting. And then, of course, there's the interesting market and really just another look at the U .S. drug system and the insurance system. So, we'll have to see what the uptake ends up being. But as of right now, a very interesting case in what is going on with these biosimilars and what happens down the line later this year when six others reach the market.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:And then you add to that, obviously, the Biden administration's push to lower some of these prescription costs. It'll be an interesting time for biopharma this year. Great stuff. Anjali Kamlani, thank you so much.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:to Yahoo Finance Live this Wednesday, February 1st. We are moments away from the Fed's decision on interest rates. Wall Street widely expecting a 25 basis point hike. Let's take a look at the markets here ahead of that decision. And we are looking at losses here with the major averages. You have the Dow off just around 296 points. NASDAQ under pressure off just about two tenths of a percent. The S &P off nearly a half of a percent. Taking a look at the bond market yields. Edging lower just a bit here ahead of this decision. Off about six basis points to 347. Not drifting too far from that three and a half line where we had really been trending for about a month or so now. Taking a look at the sector action ahead of this decision. It's a bit of a mixed, well, all in the red except for technology. You're looking at energy, the largest underperformer here, off just around two and a half percent. Technology though, Dave, barely holding on to gains.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:gains. Yeah, and largely speaking, the big names are largely holding their breath ahead of this decision. Not a whole lot of movement to the up or the downside. And you can see the names today. But really, the story has been how they perform this year. The NASDAQ outperforming the S &P and the Dow after it was battered last year. And a lot of these big names up huge. Tesla up 40 % year to date. Apple's up about 10. Google's up about 11%. Meta, we are awaiting earnings for them. We'll get them after the break. We'll have a full analysis of meta earnings up almost a quarter year to date. It's been an outstanding start. Amazon up 22%. Jen Schaumburger now with the Fedthe decision, I believe. Is she not quite ready yet?quite ready yet. You expect this to continue is\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:this week have shown the US housing slump stretched into a fifth month as home prices abroad slide lower domestically as well as abroad now despite rising interest rates is now a good time to invest in real estate here to weigh in on that and the outlook for real estate investments is principal asset management global head of research and portfolio strategy Indra Nilkar Lekha thank you for joining me Indy so I want to ask you a lot of people there's a lot of noise out there and a lot of signals to watch how are you sorting through this and determining what we should be paying attention to when trying to invest in this space\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:good morning uh Rachel as you said there's a lot of noise out in the market and and we believe that noise will continue for uh the foreseeable future and the rationale is pretty simple really if you think about what what's happening in the US economy we're seeing two forces at work one is uh inflation and the other is the Federal Reserve working hard to push that inflation level down and so what we are telling investors is really focus on those two signals very very clearly because the direction of inflation will really determine the direction of the Fed's actions and unfortunately it seems that until the Fed please from our perspective the Fed is likely to keep stay resolute in its wording and its language until it seems very clear signs that inflation is on the way down or feels comfortable that inflation is where it needs to be and until that happens we think the capital markets and real estate markets for that matter are going to remain somewhat volatile somewhat turbulent so what we are recommending investors is really stay focused on cash flows that are resilient that can withstand the spirit of turbulence that we expect over the next uh six to 12 months but also be prepared to pivot to opportunities because when there's dislocation there's also opportunity so it's really building a resilient and nimble portfolio in real estate that focuses on the full array of opportunities that is available to a real estate investor including of course uh including of course the residential sector but also be prepared to invest more opportunistically more nimbly in the in the public quadrants of real estate for example reads when they dislocate they might offer some interesting opportunities so big picture we're telling investors is be defensive recognizing that we're going to enter a period of uncertainty potential recession but be prepared to be nimble and pivot when the opportunities do arise\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:then looking within recent some of the key themes to keep an eye on when really determining when to enter the market and how to enter it\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:that's the million dollar question Rochelle I think when we look at reach we look at it more holistically from the perspective of a real estate owner and ultimately realist Reeds do offer a different form of ownership to commercial real estate albeit in the public side and so we look for similar things uh under right underlying Reeds how is their earnings what's the cash flow opportunity how resilient are these cash flows so looking at the opportunity for reads in Reads we are looking at which Read stocks are more resilient in terms of cash flows which we for reach stocks are able to generate stronger earnings despite the potential uncertainty so when we're looking at Reads we're looking at these two underlying drivers but more importantly we're also looking at when the the the timing may occur when the timing may become more favorable in terms of the quote -unquote fed pivot the great Fed pivot now that the challenge is of course is very hard to precisely determine when the Fed does stop its interest rate tightening cycle. But we believe that time will come when it feels that the inflation outlook has improved materially. And when that timing does occur, the REIT market, the US listed REIT market, will become a really interesting spot to play. And so we're looking for a couple of things. We're looking for the earnings outlook. We're looking for REITs that throw off structurally resilient cash flows. And of course, we're looking for when there are clear signs that the Fed has done, at least for the time being, with its interest rate tightening policies.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:are you seeing some of these investment strategies differ depending on age demographic?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:a great question. We believe that the US, like any other developed market, is going through a profound change in its demographic outlook. We're aging as a society. We're getting greyer. And that's leading to a whole host of different opportunities, particularly in demographically driven real estate strategies. So I'll pick on a couple. For example, if you look at the residential market in the US, it's a vast market. But for right or wrong reasons, people have typically, or investors, analysts have typically focused on this owner -occupied residential sector. We think if you step out of the owner -occupied residential sector, there are significant opportunities up and down the demographic scale to invest in it, whether it's single -family rentals, whether it's manufactured homes, whether it's age -restricted housing, whether it's senior living, whether it's assisted living. There's a whole gamut of demographic -related opportunities to invest in the US residential sector. It's not only about single -family owner -occupied homes. And that's just one example of how you can play the demographic shift that's occurring in the US. But there's also other ways of playing the demographic shifts in the US. And the other is through, for example, the retail market. The retail patterns are changing. You know, 10 years ago,-commerce as a percentage of retail sales was not as good as it is now. And now it's not as good as it is now. And so, you know, there's a lot of retail sales. What's growing, but it was pretty small. You look fast forward now, e -commerce is about 15%, 16%, 17 % of retail sales. And a lot of that has been driven by the shift in the US demographics. The millennials, the Generation Z, the younger generation, much more liable to purchase and use e -commerce on their smartphones, on their tablets. And that's changing the way the US retail industry is evolving. Bricks and mortars has always been important for retailers, but so is clicks and mortars. You know, it's because of the way the US retail industry is evolving. And so, you know, it's become really important to have that holistic experience for retailers. So that's another example of how the shifting demographics in the US is actually shifting the way we shop. And that opens up opportunities as a real estate investor. Should it be invested only in clicks, bricks and mortars, or should you also invest in companies that can give you clicks and mortars?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:fascinating. I love that. Clicks and mortars. Definitely not something we hear talked about enough. There's so much focus on those single family homes, not as much focus on demographics. Great stuff there. Principal Global Head of Research and Portfolio Strategies. Indranil Kalekar, thank you so much.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:in focus this morning after reporting mixed earnings. According to its CEO, the flat year -over -year growth reflected the rapid deceleration in the company's digital ad growth. Joining us now to break it down is Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director, Head of Internet Research. Good to have you join us this morning, Mark. And we know obviously ad spend front and center for a lot of investors at the moment. In terms of this wider tightening on ad spending, how much of the issues when it comes to Snap are Snap -specific?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:that's the right question, Rochelle. Butclearly a lot of, there's clearly softening in overall advertising spend, whether it's offline or online. And it's that pace of softening seems to have accelerated. You know, Microsoft talked about that too on their earnings call, and they account for about 10, 11 billion in ad revenue. So that was a very chunky data point. And their guidance implied acceleration in that deceleration or accelerating decline, accelerating deceleration in the growth rate. So softening is continuing into the March quarter. That's exactly what we heard from Snap last night. So there's a lot of stuff here that's macro, but there are things that are also Snap -specific. This company is trying to do a redo of some of its ad platforms to counter the impact on its advertising efficacy from the Apple privacy changes. There's also a lot of competitive risk that Snap's facing. Their daily average users, that growth is starting to slow down a little bit. So that could be the impact, ongoing impact from TikTok and maybe YouTube shorts. So there's, the answer to your question is it's both. There's macro and then there's company -specific factors.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:we look at some of those changes, especially with its direct response business, when it comes to ads, I mean, that's really been a lot of bread and butter for Snap here. How is it going to really maintain its competitive edge here? For those who don't know, this is those ads when they come up, it's an immediate call to action to buy something or sign up for something.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:that's really been the power alley of internet advertising. Direct response advertising. There's some channels on the internet that are good for brand advertising. Netflix is building out one, but generally the bread and butter, the power alley for internet advertising has been direct response advertising because historically it's been so well, it's been so measurable and you could, you know, in real time adjust campaigns. So there's a wonderful efficiency associated with it. Some of that was undermined by the Apple privacy changes, but, but some, but, but a lot of it's still intact. So, you're smart to you. I, when I was with Snap, I used to copy Pцы Variable K & Y ads as well. Now I like this I didn't, I did, I did copy other websites and mix, but I've been 有 done & company's that do this. There's two in particu, thar are really large in this space, one's called Google and one's called Metta or Facebook, Instagram. And so Snap's always had this problem like some of the other platforms like a Pinterest. Historically, a Twitter where you, in terms of search, you search vision of your Iranian best digital business. gum του There you go. times you concentrate it. So it just kind of adds to the pressure on Snap's fundamentals today. And that's why they're likely to show a year -over -year decline in ad revenue in the March quarter.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:did see some downgrades, including from UBS today. But you've kept an inline rating here and also have a price target, lowered your price target from $14 to $12. Talk about why you have still this inline rating for them.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:the stock's trading at around three times EV to sales, enterprise value to sales. That's sort of the trough level it's been at. And so what you have to ask yourself as an investor is, do you think things are going to get materially worse? Multiple will go down if fundamentals get materially worse. They are correlated. Our sense is that we're going to see kind of a macro recovery in online ad spend later in 23. And I think that a lot of the changes that are going on now at Snap that are near -to -near, that are near -to -near, are going to be more aggressive when they come out. They're going to be more aggressive in terms more aggressive in terms of what they're doing in terms of the long -term, undermining their direct response advertising, but I think can long -term help those trends. I think they're doing, they're retraining their algorithms and using artificial intelligence to kind of like what Meta is doing, except that Meta has just got so many more resources and started doing this more aggressively six or nine months ago. So they're ahead of the curve. We're a snaps behind the curve, but there is a curve. that's why I kind of want to stick to the sidelines on it. I don't think it's a sell here, but it's not a buy either. I think you've at least got a couple of quarters before you could consider being constructive on the name.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:terms of what you liked in the earnings report, what else stood out to you?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Frankly, not much. This was mostly a negative report, but there is this new asset, somewhat newer asset, it's called Spotlight. So for all the Snap users out there, they know what I'm talking about. It's kind of like their TikTok offering. So if you're on the screen far right, and you get a lot of short form video and it can be highly entertaining, addictive, like most short form video platforms, TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts, but it's a nice integration. And this is one of those, you look for those opportunities that companies have assets that they under monetize because it's a new revenue growth opportunity. Spotlight is one of those. They have very little ads, very little ad intensity in there, but there's no reason why over time, they're going to be a little bit more competitive. So I think it's a good idea to have a little bit more of that. And I think that's kind of one nice little area. Then Snapchat also has a subscription service that I think has got about 2 million users. I don't know how big that gets, but it's a nice diversification of the business model, a little bit away from advertising. I think those are two kind of modest positives you could have seen through in all the gloom last night.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:you mentioned, Meta and Google, obviously with Instagram Reels and the YouTube Shorts here, how does Snap then position itself in that? conversation when you already do have these heavy hitters? What room does that leave in terms of a competitive edge for Snap?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Rochelle, you're asking a good question. And arguably, it's a very bearish question, which is what's really special about Snap? What is special about Snap is this demographic hold that they have. And it's something like 70 % of 13 to 24 year olds in a couple of dozen countries are on Snap. So it's very popular with younger users, not primarily for privacy reasons or social media, is the SEO. So that's the subgroup they have. And so I think for all those who are using Warning Shared, and I came in with their ideation in first place. There are some four and a half interviews on LinkedIn as well. It's quite similar and꺼 has really pushed you to пош 볼iye zijn geburtenbeor города and he's got a channel about industry things, news and the business side of things. Which is really nice guys, but not advantageous. And I think most I see people opt for Squ redesign. So let's not getdemographic. So for some marketers that I think they could be a very attractive end market. And also I want to give Snap credit. They've been generally very good at product innovation, you know, over the years. So I think that's one of the reasons why they get a very strong, very good positioning with this demographic. And they still have one of the best user growth profiles out there amongst the social media assets.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:the first FOMC meeting of the year is upon us and investors will soon find out the Fed's rate height decision with expectations set for a rate height of 25 basis points. However, the lines are blurred when it comes to pinpointing where the Fed lies between dovishness and hawkishness. Here to paint the picture is Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferrer. Hey, Ines.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Rochelle. That's right. And the Federal Reserve will have this mission, which is to basically convey to the markets that they will be keeping rates higher for longer. 25 basis point rate hike, that's what the market is expecting today. But that will be a slowdown from the more aggressive rate hikes in 2022. Now, the markets this month have rallied and some strategists are pointing to the fact that investors are thinking, well, the Fed is going to pivot because it's going to be a slowdown. But the Fed is going to pivot because it's going to be a slowdown. Inflation is cooling. You've got the labor market that's cooling somewhat. So the Fed by raising by 25 basis points, that will be a slowdown, just anticipating a pivot. The Fed doesn't want that because that means that the asset prices go up and that means that demand keeps going up. The Fed wants to bring down asset prices, wants to cool the labor market, wants to cool wages in order to bring down demand, in order to bring down inflation. So some strategists are pointing to the Fed. And as the Fed has been doing, as the Fed has just have been chiming in economists, we have Ellen Zettner, chief economist from Morgan Stanley. These are her comments saying where there is a market disconnect is that the Fed keeps saying over and over again, and these are the doves and hawks alike, that the policy rate is likely to stay at peak for quite some time. Michael Gapen, chief economist from Bank of America, saying if the Fed is slowing down to a pace of 25 basis points, it's hard to push back too strongly, hard to be hawkish and strong when you just slow down again. And investor Jeff Gundlach saying, I suspect Fed messaging will push back against the pivot narrative and thereby current bond market pricing should be interesting. And finally, just want to point out macro alpha Alfonso Picocchiello. He has been on with Jared Blickery on Uncut. He says Powell will try to convince markets of hire for longer and probably calm down animal spirits. A hard job. Basically, the Fed doesn't want the markets to rally because otherwise that does make their job harder. Rochelle.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:have to see if investors believe that even as we continue to see them slow down the race of the race of paid hikes, whether that's actually going to end up meaning that the Fed is going to have to at some point make a more dovish move here. Great stuff there, Inez Ferreira.\n",

      "\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Investor expectations are set for the Fed to trim the sign of its rate hike again, as the narrative for a pivot remains unclear and recession concerns linger. But what does this spell out for the year ahead? Here to discuss is Dana Dioria, Investnet Co -Chief Investment Officer. Good to see you, Dana. So a lot of optimism priced in here at the moment. They'll be looking at that basis point hike, but wondering, should we really believe the hawkish tone of Fed Chair Powell given this movement? What's your take on how investors are really reacting right now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:it's amazing. It's actually so interesting because, you know, don't fight the Fed, right? But the market is absolutely sending a different signal. The market is absorbing the economic data that we've seen come in. There's absolutely an expectation of a pivot and, you know, a lower terminal rate. And, you know, not only just this year, but even more so as we move into next year. Meantime, the Fed keeps telling us, you know, no, expect a higher terminal rate. We're going to be seeing a lot of changes in the market. We're going to be seeing a lot of changes in the market. We're going to be seeing a lot of changes in the market. We're going to see we're going to hold or hike and hold, right? So even when we're done actually hiking rates, we'll be holding it for a while. So, I mean, the question, of course, becomes, you know, how do you as an investor sort of react to this? And I think, you know, some of it is yet to be determined, right? We'll see economic news that may or may not impact the Fed, but net net, I think assuming that the Fed will pivot earlier than what they're saying is a riskier kind of a bet. I think it stems from years of having the Fed kind of step in. And that was years, you got to remember, of inflation not being what it is today.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:anything you think Powell could say at this point that would really surprise the markets?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think Powell has to stay on message. There are things he could say. I think if he was, you know, more dovish than folks expected, that would really, you know, that would surprise the markets, right? But I don't expect that at all. I expect actually that he's going to stay on message. And even if, you know, there is the thought of, hey, you know, depending on where the data goes, maybe we do ease off a little bit more quickly than expected. He's not going to say that today to the markets at all. I mean, we have sticky wage increases. We have earnings expectations being put into the market now, right? You know, declines in earning expectations, you know, and that's happening kind of slowly. As companies come out, analysts are slowly sort of downgrading expectations related to things like operating margins, you know, companies not able to necessarily pass on greater price increases at the rate that they were facing in terms of wage inflation, et cetera. So all that has to work into the market. But I don't expect any unexpected news from Powell today.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:then as we look at things, as they work their way through the market, as we look at the Fed's medicine still waiting to take hold in the broader economy, what does that mean? And what does that mean in terms of how you allocate your assets in this period?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:look, you know, a few big takeaways. One, and you're hearing this, I think, a lot of places, but if you're not globally diversified, if you've had this mantra in your head about the last 10 years, you know, U .S. outperforming and why do I need international stocks? I think we actually just recently had, you know, with the mild winter that Europe is experiencing and the change from expectation of a pretty hefty recession in Europe to now, you know, the global economy, you know, now, hey, they might avoid recession altogether. It really kind of tells you something about markets in general about, you know, the value of prognostication at that level. If you're not globally diversified, you really should be thinking about that. Markets are cyclical. 10 years of U .S. outperformance, yes. But what happened in the last decade? It was 10 years of earning nothing in the S &P 500. But if you were internationally diversified, you had return coming to you.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:obviously a lot of focus on the Fed, but what are some of the risks that investors also should be paying attention to? You mentioned international markets, you have China reopening, you have the debt ceiling. What are some of the biggest risks you think that investors should be paying more attention to right now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think we have, you know, the market has short -term risks and they have long -term risks. You know, short -term risks, the debt ceiling debacle, it's just painful that we have to continually go through this. You know, I think the U .S. and Denmark are the only two countries that have this sort of a system where we can, we spend the money, right? The debt ceiling debate is about paying the bills that we've already created. It's about future spending. But, you know, we do this to ourselves, right? Where we have to now play fast and loose with whether we're going to pay the bill or not. So that's going to royal markets. And depending on how much brinksmanship, I mean, we saw what happened, you know, in 2011 and it was pretty painful on markets. So I think that's a risk short -term. You mentioned it, China reopening, where that goes, you know, the bad economic data coming in, markets repricing on earnings, et cetera. Earnings not probably going to be what, you know, even they're forecasted now, they've got more repricing to go. Long -term, you know, we're pricing in more structural differences. Are we going to get back to inflation at 2 %? Or are we going to be living in a world with a little bit higher inflation for longer, 3 % maybe, et cetera? You know, those are longer -term risks. And that leads you to say, hey, you know, P multiples may not be what they were in the past. The expected return on stocks may not be what it has been.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:what point do you think we'll get to some sort of sense of normalcy? Obviously, it's still macroeconomic pressure, still weighing on earnings, keeping an eye on margins. At what point do you think we'll see perhaps a leveling off of some of this volatility?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:it's an interesting question because like, what is normal, you know, at this point? So much change in the last few years. You know, we've gone from a world where tech is kind of defensive to back to growth being more risky because, you know, there's cost to money. I would say in terms of normalcy from the Fed, we are getting there. You know, the highlight, I would say, is last year, we had so much volatility in terms of just these very abrupt and very high increases. Now, at least we kind of have, we're kind of in a place where the data is coming in where we expect it to, right? Inflation is coming in where we expect it to. We're seeing a rolling over. So I do think that markets will benefit, if not by a Fed pivot, by some understanding of what the Fed's going to do, not as much volatility in what that rate is going to be. And I do think to a certain extent, that is its own return to normalcy.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:as we await a pivot, whenever that does end up happening, obviously, we still have to have a pause before we even get to the pivoting point. Then how should people start looking at their portfolios, trying to plan for the future right now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:well, so in addition to, you know, kind of that whole global diversification, we do get asked about, you know, should fixed income be part of the portfolio or in the same, you know, amounts that it was? And I would say, planning ahead, you do want to think about what your fixed income position is in the future. And that's where we're going to be. And I think that's where we're going to be. I think that's where we're going to be at the end of the year, as opposed to the portfolio. You've already experienced a lot of the pain, right. So watching the AG drop 13 % double digits in the same year that the S &P drops 18 % very painful and raises questions about, you know, the traditional 6040. But on the other hand, how much more pain do we really expect, even if the Fed goes as high as it says it is, and the market has to reprice a little, that's nothing like what we experienced last year. So I would say, you know, just dealing with advisors and retail clients, looking at how much ballast you have in the portfolio, whether you expect a pivot and great markets ahead or not, making sure you're paying attention to that client's risk tolerance and say, you know, do I have the right ballast? Do I have, you know, safer assets in there at the rate, at the allocation that they need to be?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:we have to take a closer look at portfolios right now. A big thank you there to Dana Dioria, Investnet Co -Chief Investment Officer. Thank you so much.\n",

Oreo maker Mondelez certainly beating on both the top and bottom line here as consumers look to their favorite chocolate treats and perhaps those Ritz crackers during inflation.

In addition to that, they also did note that drivers of this past year, as well as the fourth quarter results, were based upon acquisitions of Clif Bar, among other acquisitions, but they were offset by unfavorable currency that impacted across the board in 2022. In addition to that, they did note that they announced an agreement with Perfetti Von Malle to acquire our developed markets gum business. So of course, they are the makers behind Trident and Stride. Some businesses are in US, Canada, and Europe. That deal expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023. Another announcement made on this earnings release is a $6 billion share buyback program that's expected to go through December of 2025. So lots to unpack as investors and Main Street certainly looked to this company for a sweet relief, I guess you could say. Toblerone,\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:legendary airport purchase, the Toblerone. Cadbury's pretty good too. All right, what are analysts looking for? What do they wanna hear?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:well, I really think they do wanna understand how exactly the consumer is responding during this time, largely looking as Easter is around the corner for that Cadbury purchases. Perhaps, are they responding to a higher price? Are they still going to flock to those favorite treats, especially upon the Easter season? I think in addition to that, they definitely wanna hear more on just the impact that we're seeing overseas as in Europe continues to work through those high, inflationary pressures, as we heard from other executives like McDonald's today on the call. In addition to that, as we spoke to Mondelez last year, and I believe it was 2021, Ukraine continues to be a major business for them. So perhaps analysts hoping to hear more on that front as well.\n",

You can see 4 .6 % gain on the day. UPS projecting full year revenue for 2023 between 97 and 99 billion, 0 .4 billion, just shy of the streets estimates. UPS CFO Brian Newman saying on Thursday's earnings call quote weeks. We expect 2023 to be a bumpy year. Headwinds that will impact the business, including record high inflation, recession fears, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China and U .S. labor negotiations.shares of UPS edging higher today as the company projects some of those concerns to subside in the second half of the year. So again, just reiterating they see a recession first half, a recovery in the economy. And we're going to look at the UPS. And in their business in the second half.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:you got to look at this package volume. It's a little bit concerning when you take a look at the broader economy, what that's what that could signal, at least for the coming quarters. We know that the holiday period is so important for UPS, so important for its rival FedEx. And when you see that package volume drop coming up a bit short, rather, I should say consumers really pulling back on their spending. What exactly the signals here for the next quarter or two could be something to really keep an eye on. And then also, you know, labor negotiations. We know that's going to be front and center for UPS over the next couple of quarters. Those negotiations are expected to start in April. Of course, how that pans out could have real implications for UPS.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:some feel this will be the most contentious labor talks they've had since the strike in 1997. They're dealing with the Teamsters. This is going to be a real tough road is going to cost them a pretty penny. They did increase shipping prices 6 .9%. That's on top of the 5 .9 the prior year and 4 .9 prior to that. So not a great story in terms of inflation coming down because they are continuing to increase prices there at UPS.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:they certainly are. When you take a look at that price increase, it's also going to be a question of whether or not consumers are willing to spend how much they will be shipping, whether or not that, of course, is going to impact their behavior down the line.

The beat coming after McDonald's raised its prices by about 10 % in its previous quarter to combat those higher operating costs that we've been hearing about. Now, to put the prices in perspective, we took a look at some of their most popular items. You have the Big Mac, fries, and the McChicken. So this is comparing to prices back in 2019, about three years ago. The Big Mac price is up 7%. Fries have jumped nearly 25%. The McChicken up nearly 28 % despite these price hikes. Dave, it looks like when you take a look at some of the traffic inside their stores, consumers are trading down to McDonald's and willing to spend there.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:when I look at this report, I'm shocked at the investor reaction. Across the board, they do say their prices, to your point, up 10 % on average. From a year earlier. But dive inside these numbers. U .S. visits up 26%. That's from pre -pandemic, from 2019 levels. They're up 30 % from a year ago. And if you want one more thing, how about an operating margin of 45 %? That was 40 a year ago. They have raised prices. Consumers continue to pay it. And we have seen in the past, McDonald's has proven to be recession resistant. I think it's a pretty stellar report.\n",

You've had a McRib and not a Big Mac? I have\n",

The S &P is still well here to the upside over the past month. We're looking at gains of over 5 .5%, up just about 1 % today. But the Nasdaq has certainly been the outperformer over the last several weeks. We're looking at gains of just over 10 % for the month. The Nasdaq 100 also leading the way today, as we certainly have seen. There's a bit of a reversal in terms of what investors, what traders are favoring here this year. Certainly betting on some of those beaten down names that we saw certainly get hammered during the month or during the year of 2022. Take a look at some of the trending names here. A big day for earnings. GM. McDonald's. Just some of the names here reporting earnings. Taking a look at General Motors on an intraday basis. We're looking at gains of just about 7 % strong results there. Spotify popping about 12 .5%. We'll dig into that in just a little bit. Exxon Mobil, another strong report here from that company ahead of the bell. Up just nearly 2 % on the day. Record profits from Exxon following in the footsteps of Chevron last week. Taking a look at that sector action on an intraday basis. Mostly green on the screen. You're looking at consumer discretionary leading the way up just about 2%. Materials, real estate not too far behind. The laggard in today's action has certainly been utilities. I mentioned some of those earnings reports. Let's take a look at more broadly speaking the energy sector. A bit of a mixed picture, but Exxon certainly the winner today of nearly 2%. Chevron, on the other hand, one of the underperformers inside the Dow. You're looking at Chevron off just about a tenth of a percent, Dave.

Now, the uncertainty leading some analysts to consider ETFs this year for investing. Here with more, Ben Slavin, BNY Mill and Global Head of ETFs. Good to see you, Ben. Obviously, investors have a lot to take on at the moment. You have obviously that Fed uncertainty, this holding pattern that we're in at the moment. What are some of the top questions that clients who are perhaps interested in ETFs really have for you right now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:certainly investors are watching the Fed, but we see ETFs off to a strong start here in 2023. But what the data shows really is, to some degree, a lack of conviction. We've seen it really flow across the board. And what's interesting to note is with all the investor choice that's available in the ETF market, we see investors looking. We're looking at actively managed ETFs here in January, both in fixed income and equity, as a way to potentially play this market and potentially get some advice.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Ben, I want to talk about some of these inflows. We're seeing 610 billion inflows into ETFs last year. You're predicting a record $1 trillion this year. What is going to get it there?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:look, we've seen an acceleration of ETF flow into the market. Investors just simply chipped. They're just going to keep going. And we're seeing a lot of people choosing ETFs as a preferred way to invest, really at the expense of mutual funds. And we saw that trend play out last year. And the gap between outflows coming out of mutual funds into ETFs has grown really to the widest gap ever. And that swing was about $1 .5 trillion. This year, again, we're off to a strong start. And we see more issuers coming to market with new products. So it's not just passively managed. It's not just a managed product. It's certainly active. And now that the investor preference seems to be accelerating, here at BNY Mellon, we're seeing really a large queue of clients lining up either to enter the ETF market or to bring new products to market. And we think that trend will continue here. And I think we could really be within reach of getting to that $1 trillion mark this year.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Ben, in terms of standouts, specific ETFs that have offered the best returns over this period? As we get ready for the next quarter? As we get ready to get into more traditional quarter point rate hikes from the Fed?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:certainly we've seen investor interest in international equities, which is not something I've been saying much the last couple of years. And if you look at the top of the leaderboard, you see European equities at the top of the leaderboard gathering flow. And certainly they've performed well with investor sentiment thinking like dollar may have peaked. And certainly valuation seeming attractive. And we started to see a run up there really in the European equities. Also, fixed income is continuing to catch a bit from investors. But what's interesting about that fixed income flow is we're seeing it really across the board. It's high yield. It's investment grade. It's short duration. It's long duration. And we're even seeing sort of the mortgage side of the market also pick up investor interest. Really, again, trying to position around expectations around what the Fed may or may not do.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:a lot of options out there, as you mentioned there. You have the equity ETFs, fixed income. You also have the dividend ETFs as well. For people who are trying to position themselves right now, what sort of allocation should they be looking at?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:you know, certainly last year what we have seen was a real sort of wake up call. Those who were invested in a traditional 64 -day period. The 40 -type allocation had a really rough go of it. Really a historic rough go of it. So what we've seen really is a lot of repositioning by investors. Looking at those allocations, harvesting tax losses in many cases, and using that opportunity to take a look at other possibilities in their portfolio, specifically to lower cost, reposition tactically, and certainly adjust their fixed income allocations. You know, after the large run up. You know, we've seen a lot of growth in the bond market last year. And so, again, we've seen a really historic volume in ETFs that was in place last year. We've seen, again, a strong start here to January. And, again, a lot of repositioning. So the advice to investors is really to look at this opportunity to readjust, reallocate your portfolio, and take a look at the new options that are out there. Whether it be, again, to offer a new slice of your portfolio. With some exposure you didn't have before. Lower fees. And, again, harvest your taxes as well if there are losses inherent in your allocation.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:US labor watchdog is now recommending Apple settle with its former employees, according to reporting by Bloomberg. Now this comes after its board found evidence supporting claims of harassment and the suppression of worker unions. Yahoo! Finance's Ali Garfinkel has the latest. Ali, another development for unions here.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:development for unions here, definitely, Rochelle. So this is actually kind of a different sort of labor story we have coming out of Apple. The NLRB here has essentially ruled that Apple's policies as they currently exist are violating workers' rights. Now what does this mean? So what the NLRB is basically saying is that Apple's higher ups and their imposition of strict confidentiality rules are what violate and limit collective action, that they're even coercive. Now what is this really all about here? It's really all about how Apple is paranoid about employees leaking information is what we're getting. At the center of this all is a whistleblower who's in the midst of a lawsuit with Apple. Her name is Ashley Jovic, and she used to be a senior engineer for Apple. She's been working for Apple for a long time. She's been working for Apple for a long time. She's been working for Apple for a long time. She's been working for Apple for a long time. As part of her case, she submitted a number of documents, including a rather newsworthy email from Tim Cook. The email basically says to workers, hey, here's the deal. We don't want you linking. We are actually looking for places where you are leaking. So there's been no comment from Jovic or Apple so far. However, based on the complaint in the ruling, it seems like they're also on the hunt to identify and fire anyone who's leaking confidential information. You see it here from this 2021 email that Jovic leaked. We know that leakers constitute a small number of people. We know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here. Apple has been the good guy in the tech unionization story so far in certain ways, especially because they've been the first to come to the table with workers in their Towson, Maryland store. However, this also comes after the NLRB's December ruling that Apple legally interfered with elections in both New York and Atlanta. So where does this all leave us? In the end, this is a very interesting story. We have a lot of news here. We have a lot of news to share. And I think this is important to remember that the NLRB has no ability whatsoever to impose punitive damages. However, this does also show that the NLRB is really not letting this go. And it also, I think, gives credence to the claim that Apple is surveilling its employees right on the edge of legality. And sometimes it appears they're crossing the line.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:certainly be following in that story. Interesting to see how that plays out. As you mentioned, given Apple's appearance, at least, of being first to come to the table when it comes to these unionization pushes. Great stuff there. Ali Garfinkel, thank you so much.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:That's right. Let's get to it. We got some winners and some losers. This is our earnings heat map. Oh, let me get to this. This is our earnings heat map of what's happened today. Now, let's start with Spotify. This stock is up about 10 percent. Let me just show you on a one year basis what it's done. Now we can go through some of the numbers. This is the highest price that we've seen in Spotify since September. And that's after beating expectations on the key metric of premium subscriber gains. And you can count 10 million of those people in the fourth quarter. Now, leading Bloomberg Intelligence to suggest that, quote, guidance for two million additions in the first quarter may be conservative. So maybe some upside there. Also, gross margin catching the eye of Citigroup. They rate it with a buy with a price target of $140. They're saying that they should elevate the stock along with the monthly active users beat. And this is because the biggest concerns or this is in spite of some of the biggest concerns being that the macro environment and a slowing economy may weigh on the stock. But I think everybody's kind of saying that. Now, here's a max chart. And you can see a lot of stocks like this look like that round trip over the pandemic. Now, it's kind of a long slog to get back to the top, but a decent stop start there for Spotify. Now, we got to get to ExxonMobil. And let me dial this down to ExxonMobil. A one year chart. We're talking about records for the oil major. Now, they missed on revenue, but they posted a record profit of fifty nine point one billion dollars for the year. Now, this is a bit shy of the ninety eight point eight billion dollars that's expected from Apple this Thursday. But when it comes to cash flow, it's knocking on Apple's door there, too. And let me just show you this chart that we have prepared here. This has to do with the cash flow record cash flow raked in by U .S. companies as part of the S &P 500. Here's Apple, the top spot in twenty twenty two. They raked in one hundred twenty two billion dollars. And then at the bottom, we got Exxon. They raked in seventy six point eight billion dollars. So for the U .S. oil majors, it's all about the return of cash flow. And now we want to move on just a little bit here because we got McDonald's. Now, that stock is taking a little bit of a hit here. It's down about two and a half percent. And let's let's see what we got here. We can see it's in the upper end of its range here on a one year basis. The key metric of global same store sales. That was a nice beat for the comps. I was up three percent in the quarter. Now, CEO Chris Kaczemski highlights the company's focus on technology. Also, its ability to deliver deliver options through that delivery system. That's reaping dividends for the company. Now, the delivery sales more than doubled in the quarter. And after the bell, guess what? Focus going to turn to AMD. So let me get up our chip sector here. Now, the chip sector is very highly leveraged. We can see that AMD is moving forward to the business cycle, meaning that has the vicissitudes of the ups and downs. We can see AMD up two and a half percent today. Chip stocks doing pretty well this year. You can see AMD is up 15 percent and the company is potentially set to beat beat its test about its prospects for growth this year. And this is amid a general malaise among its competitors. So. So AMD is still making headway into the server space. And if Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse dream ever comes true, AMD is set to profit. Now, traders are pricing a 19 percent move after the bell. So stay tuned. Stay tuned. You're not going to want to miss it. We're going to bring that to you live,\n",
      "SPEAKER_02:right. Great stuff. Very long play on that metaverse. But, you know, we're seeing a lot of movement in that. It could happen. Still bullish on it. It could, you know, anything could. Great stuff there, Jared Blakery for us.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:well, staying with the chips conversation, the United States reportedly furthering its crackdown on the Chinese tech sector, and specifically Huawei. Now, this is the likes of AMD and Qualcomm gear up to report quarterly results. Here to discuss the wider sector is Thomas Hayes, a Great Hill Capital chairman and managing partner. Good to see you, Thomas.a lot to unpack here.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:lot to unpack\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:you. So as we look at some of the pressures that are in this sector, give us the temperature of what's been happening as we look at this push by US policymakers and the ripple effects.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:it's been a strong move since October, the US kind of made US chip makers get a license in order to sell advanced calculations and semiconducting equipment to China. So moving forward, the big news now is that they've gotten the Netherlands and Japan to join on restricting exports of advanced chip making equipment. This is a big deal because ASML, it focuses on the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. They're the only company in the world that makes them. Whereas Japan focuses on the deep ultraviolet light lithography machines. And this will hamstring China's initiative to develop their own semiconductor business domestically, but it won't completely impair it. I mean, right now, SMIC, which is the big fab that was developed in 2000 to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor, is still in the process of developing a semiconductor business. And so, you know, it's producing chips at about 45 nanometers versus Taiwan Semiconductor, though, is producing at seven nanometers. So I think the big issue that came today is now it's a unified front. It's not just the US unilaterally making these restrictions. It's now the Netherlands and Japan, which are the major suppliers for this advanced machinery.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:this is coming at a time where we have a chip glut at the moment, and we're seeing that from the US. So I think it's a big issue. And I think it's a big issue for the US. And I think that's a big issue. And I think that's a big issue for the US. And I think it's a big issue for the US. that ripple effect then affecting some of these Asian suppliers as well. What is the outlook then? Because obviously, demand isn't going to be picking up anytime soon from some of the estimates that we're looking at. What is the play here for some of these chip companies?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:we may have hit peak inventory. And usually when we hit peak inventory historically, the sector starts to rally in anticipation of it easing. And we may have actually seen the bottom of semiconductors in October. I know that's hard to believe when you saw Intel really not deliver what everyone expected last week. But I think if you look longer term, and I think we're gonna see some more green shoots from AMD tonight, and maybe even Qualcomm. Qualcomm is with the handsets, but AMD has the data center, and the PCs has been the most hurt. The other thing to keep in mind when you see like Texas Instruments, the auto industry, the amount of chips that go into each car is accelerating, and there's been two years of pent up demand for new cars. We do think used cars will do poorly in the next year or two. However, we think new cars with dealer incentives, and you're already seeing it with Tesla cutting prices, with Ford following suit with their Mach -E, that demand for chips and capacity is going to shift to auto chip demand. And with the average car on the road at 13 .1 years old, Rochelle, I think that the chip sector is gonna do just fine reallocating that capacity, until the data center, the PC, and the handsets recovers after some pull forward in 2020 and 2021.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:mean, and as we look at things like handsets, in terms of strategy, we're looking at Samsung, they're actually expecting, they're actually going to be increasing, they're keeping their capital spending at last year's levels when you have Micron, Hynix, Kyosha, all pulling back on their spending. What's your take on that strategy? What could they potentially be risking by focusing so much on market share that they might end up losing out on profitability?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:I think they're certainly playing the long game. I think you saw the IMF last night come out and say that global growth was gonna be better than expected. I think a lot of people really underestimated the impact of China's reopening. You know, the government set 5 % reopening targets. The government in China has also been stimulating and easing since March of last year, but it didn't matter until they opened the doors and allowed people to leave their apartments and get back to life. All the stimulus in the world wasn't gonna help. Now it's all happening at once. You have nine months of backlog stimulus, monetary policy easing, coupled with people getting back to life and the pent up demand, revenge spending, revenge travel like we saw in the US from late 2020 to 2021. That's now just starting. And I do think those 5 % GDP targets that the government set are gonna be very, very conservative. And we're seeing a lot of banks now come out expecting growth. And what that means for the global economy, a rising tide lifts all boats. The second largest economy in the world is gonna grow faster than expected, and that's gonna help Europe tremendously, which is why everyone calling for a recession in Europe this winter has been incorrect in part. Number one, the US has stepped up as a natural gas producer, but number two, that China reopening is really helping get things back in gear. And number three, it's gonna help US earnings. And that's a key factor moving forward. Because the S &P 500, some of the considerable amount of those earnings will benefit from China's reopening as well. So I think things are pointing in the right direction. And I think Samsung might be right to play the long game, pick up share while everyone else is weak, inventories are peaking. And then when the demand picks up in 12 or 18 months, they've gained share.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:it's interesting because Samsung is expecting the chip recovery to begin in the second half of this year. Are you seeing anything that supports that kind of recovery, starting that quickly?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:I see it in the auto sector. So you have seen capacity reallocation. So where there's excess supply in the handsets and the PCs, they've been moving towards auto. And every single company that provides auto chips has been reporting record sales, demand is picking up. And you're seeing it also in the auto makers starting to rise because they're finally getting the chips they need to sell cars. For two years, on the one hand, they had the luxury of selling above sticker, and people would pay whatever they could to get the limited supply. Now, the chips are coming in, the semiconductors companies are making a lot of money on the chips, but now the OEMs, the car manufacturers are putting supply on the lots. They're gonna start to do incentives and you're gonna see a massive amount of new cars. So we do think used cars will do very, very poorly over the next 12 to 24 months. New cars are gonna do much better than expected. In a slowdown, no one's gonna buy new cars, but in a 7 % interest rate environment, when the dealers start coming out and saying 0 % APR, 2 .9 % APR, you can buy it at sticker or below sticker, I think people with their 13 year old cars on average are gonna get out there and take advantage.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:offer certainly will start looking a lot better. A big thank you there, Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thank you so much.\n",

Now, one surprising entrant in that second category, the U .K., the only leading economy the IMF says will see a recession this year.

They're just up slightly. They're about a quarter of a percent, 87 points. The S &P 500, they're up two -thirds of a percent, up 30 points. And the Nasdaq up 1 percent.we keep an eye on what's been happening with the earnings season, seeing how, as everything rolls out, really people, investors trying to get a gauge on what this means for consumers going forward.

So we'll see how that plays out for consumers and the fears of recession, which haven't come off the table yet. And, of course, a lot of analysts debating whether or not this is going to be a deep recession or prolonged stagflation. Well, that'll do it for now. I'm Rochelle Okuva.

      "SPEAKER_01:are reporting an earnings beat for the fourth quarter, but issuing some weak guidance for its COVID -19 vaccine products. Yahoo Finance's Anjali Kemlani joins us now with more. We see there the stock under pressure as a result.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:right, Rochelle. Unfortunately, we know that with everything that is going on with the pandemic as it stands right now with the White House itself calling for the end of the pandemic in May, the companies, including Pfizer, are now looking for a downgrade in what they expect for sales related to their COVID products. That includes for Pfizer specifically the Comirnaty vaccine that it shares with BioNTech, as well as Paxlovid, the treatment, downgrading those to basically a fraction of what we saw in recent years. $13 .5 billion is the revenue estimate for 23 and $8 billion for Paxlovid there you see on your screen. Meanwhile, the company boasting a beyond $100 billion for the first time in full year revenue for 2022. That's the first time the company has reached that high in its 174 year history, I believe. And so that's something that they're pretty excited about. And of course, we know this all comes because of those COVID products. If you look at quarter over quarter, when the company was breaking out its revenue for a time, you saw that operational growth really surpassed, I mean, a significant number of the company's revenue for a time. If you look at the before quarter, the company's revenue for a time, you saw numbers they were just 82%, for example, in the first quarter of 22 compared to without COVID products, an increase of 2%. And you can see on your screen just how that progressed over time. So getting beyond that now, the company's really looking beyond what they can do. So the COVID products is one obstacle. The other one is a loss of exclusivity on some of their products, looking at a hit of 17 billion in the coming years and that is something that Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, has done. has specifically talked about with recent acquisitions, as well as 19 products in the pipeline, being able to offset that 17 billion. That's the expectation for this year and through the upcoming years. And so we'll have to see how that all pans out. And that's one of the reasons why some analysts, including at Wells Fargo, they downgraded Pfizer recently, hoping to see some of that come to fruition. So right now the company really focused kind of back to square one a little bit of where they were pre -pandemic on trying to focus and prove the point that they are more than just a XYZ company, in this case, more than just a vaccine company and more than just a COVID company. So really setting the stage here, as many of the comments from the executives today, really setting the stage for strong capital allocation, including, by the way, more focus on the commercialization of the COVID vaccine. And that is going to need as well, sales and support. So they're spending on that as well as R &D. So full picture, a lot still going on. So that's what's going on for Pfizer right now.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:let's take a look at some of the big movers of the day and take a look at Lucid because this stock has been on a wild ride over the past two trading days. Lucid closing off just over 8 % today, still up about 30 % when you factor in today's trading action and Friday's trading action. The two day jump coming on the heels of news that Saudi Arabia's public investment fund will potentially want to buy out the rest of the EV makers shares here. Saudi Arabia's fund already opened up. About 60 % of Lucid, a lot of excitement following that speculation. Those reports, Dave, on Friday coming back down just a bit, giving up some of those gains today. But I think the big question here going forward with Lucid is what this company is going to look like given the broader macroeconomic landscape right now, given the competition from Tesla, given the fact that the price cuts placing even more pressure on a name like Lucid. You're scratching your head here really trying to figure out what this company looks like when you move forward.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I don't know how much they're impacted by those price cuts. This is a much more expensive end of the segment. You're talking about the cheapest Lucid car, $87 ,000 and most of them priced well north of 100K. So it's a very different consumer. But Morgan Stanley did say they are impacted by what they call the Hunger Games pricing war, which is pretty descriptive. But that stock just a wild ride Friday. 43 % climbing was holding up. It's a very different consumer. But Morgan Stanley did say they are impacted by what they call the Hunger Games pricing war, which is pretty descriptive.

And especially right now, just given that broader economic landscape, a shrinking consumer wallet, clearly an issue here for Lucid, for Rivian, some of those cars that are so expensive. Like you said, Wall Street seems to be a little bit mixed. We had a number of price targets cut in the week or so leading up to this report on Friday. Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to five bucks a share CFR. Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to five bucks a share CFR. Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to five bucks a share CFR. Lowered their price target to 12 bucks a share. So we'll see whether or not this deal. In fact, it does go through.\n",

So a 10 city average occupancy is at a post pandemic high, albeit still below 50%. Well out of the pandemic. What's the impact of remote work on commercial real estate values? Kevin Fagan is the head of commercial real estate analysis at Moody's. Kevin, good to see you. How do you measure the impact of remote work on commercial real estate values?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:that's a million dollar question right now. And I think there are a lot of us in the forecasting and analytics side have been working on that for the last three years, actually. And I think this is going to be a really exciting year because we're finally going to be really this the first year we'll be fully past COVID and we'll be able to use this as a bellwether year to see what the return to office actually looks like. You know, we had Omicron last summer and we had Omicron last year. And then the summer, the fall, there was kind of a comeback. But now this is the real full comeback. And we'll get to see exactly when these leases start expiring, these long term leases for offices of which there's a lot expiring in 2023. We'll get to see what's actually happening when tenants are making decisions about how much space per employee they want to take versus what they did pre COVID. We've seen a little bit of that, but it's at this stage right now. in such a transition period where companies are trying to figure that out. We haven't gotten a lot of really solid clues yet. There's been just as many stories of, you know, tenants re -signing for as much space or more that they had before, like in the last three years. And we've also seen a lot of the stories where tenants are pulling back. It really depends a lot on the individual companies, but we haven't seen a widespread shift away from it. But this year might offer some real clues for the first time.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:it seems like most you talk to are reducing that footprint. Do you get a sense that returned office versus remote work is at least beginning to level out in 23?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think that, I think that CASEL number that you showed there of nearly, about, let's say right around 60 % makes a lot of sense. You know, you're going to have a lot of hybrid working now where you have people coming in maybe two days a week, three days a week. Maybe it'll average around three. That's what we can see from a lot of surveys. So you kind of have a lot of people coming in maybe two days a week, three days a week. Maybe it'll average off the beginning and end of the week. That basically means your badge swipes that CASEL is monitoring is going to level out somewhere around 60%. And that makes sense. Now, the real key here is of that 40 % where you don't have people in the office, how efficiently can you turn that into less office space? And it's not really clear that you can be that efficient with that. So that's the kind of magic number, your efficiency factor.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:how have those buildings that are now much more competitive, those buildings, those landlords, how have they been forced to evolve in what they're offering potential tenants?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:we started to see offices get to be managed more and more like hospitality, even pre -COVID. That was really kind of starting to ramp up. We actually saw a lot of partial remote working somewhere around the order of 9 % to 10 % on average across the nation. So obviously COVID changed that. But even before COVID, we started to see hospitality -like management of offices. So that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it. And I think that's a big part of it. So obviously COVID changed that. But even before COVID, we started to see hospitality -like management of offices, especially in that high -end Class A, high -amenity space already start to happen. Hudson Yards is a great example in New York. And really, I think that's going to evolve in a really major way. I wouldn't say it's kind of like the iPhone revolutionizing cell phones back in 2007 exactly. But we are at a real precipice here where the experience of the office is about to be very different. So dynamic social spaces. Actually here at Moody's, we just finished a whole new project where we're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We're going to be building a new office. We a floor that's very archetypical of what we're seeing now in a lot of renovations of office space where you have just an incredible amount of collaborative, different kinds of collaborative space, recharge areas. We have two libraries in that new space. We have like three different types of collaborative space. You have recharge space. So I think you're going to see a lot more of that, a lot more outdoor space. So yeah, that's really the design changes are pretty dramatic.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:recently played pickleball at a New York office building. Moving forward, the concept of conversion from commercial slash office space to residential, where are we seeing that and how much do you think it'll pick up in 2023?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:you have to have a pretty steep decline in values and rents for offices to be viable candidates for conversion into apartment. We had done a study on New York where we found that maybe 3 % were viable candidates from both like a physical shape of the buildings, because some buildings cannot really be efficiently converted into apartments, but also just economically, we hadn't seen a big enough decline in office space, excuse me, office values and office rents for it to be profitable for builders to actually take the risk of that kind of conversion.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:for some of our after hours trending tickers. Let's take a look at two names. We have Whirlpool and NXP. It's all about earnings this week. Kicking it off with Whirlpool, we're looking at gains here in extended trading up just about 2%. Some nuggets here from this earnings report guidance meeting the streets expectations. They see revenue of 19 .4 billion for the year. EPS outlook in line with the streets estimates as well. A reason why we're seeing the stock pop here in extended trading. I think a lot of that has to do with one line here in the report that the company does expect 800 to $900 million benefit this year in part due to some easing raw material inflation costs here. That of course is expected to benefit the company going forward intraday basis ahead of these results. The stock closed the trading day lower here over the last three months. We're looking at gains of nearly 10 % ahead of this earnings report. The company announced that its president and COO would be leaving the company. Let's take a look at NXP semiconductors again. A mover here in extended trading. We'll get losses of nearly 4%. Now the company here revenue forecast missing the streets expectations. That's a huge driver in this extended hours trading activity right now. Q4 EPS did beat the streets expectation revenue coming in just in line up about 9 % on a year over year basis. But that weak guidance that is what's dragging the stock lower after hours over the last three months. We're looking at gains of just about 18 % over the last six months.

Injuries no doubt hurt the ratings as the Eagles eviscerated the Niners down to their fourth string QB, but a massive number well north of 30, probably 40 million. No doubt watch Patrick Mahomes escape to top Borough and the Bengals should get those numbers later tonight. Just the latest example of the NFL continuing to assert its will over the entire television landscape. However, the league took a big L in their streaming kickoff ratings for Amazon Thursday Night Football down astounding 41 % from 2021 from an average of 16 .4 million to fewer than 10 million viewers ratings for ESPN. Solid just slightly down from last season. 13 .4 million Eagles Chiefs will win the NFL. It will be awesome more than 110 million people excuse me will watch while the battle bean counters are considering is ratings versus revenue and this one is a blowout unlike the Super Bowl Amazon and the NFL want more viewers on Thursday night. But cash is King here. The league still featured 88 of the top 100 most watched shows in 2022. And here's the score that matters most. $113 billion over the last two years. Over 11 seasons. That's how much the league's media partners will fork over YouTube Sunday NFL ticket deal said to be worth as much as 2 .5 bill per year. The commish he sees cord cutting accelerating more than 20 million since 2014. A number expected to grow to 80 million by 26. The most common age group to adios cable 18 to 29 year olds. Amazon would point out their median age. Viewer this season is 47. That may sound old. It's seven years younger than the legacy networks. The ratings will improve as streaming picks up and the matchups will also improve. Al Michaels called him dreadful and equated them to selling used cars. They have to be better. But like the big banks, the NFL is too big to fail and they're too big to care about one ratings miss like recent earnings reports. Guidance is all that matters here. And football is 100 % recession proof. My point being a lot of people are making a lot of the streaming number, Shauna, and for good reason. It's Amazon. But they're not scared. They're not scared one bit. Growth is all there. The league will continue to explode when it comes to television ratings. And Amazon's numbers I think will grow over the years. NFL's big question was would it look competent? Would the stream go down? Would the broadcasters be solid? It looked like just like NBC or CBS except for the awful matchups.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:it was just an amazing way that they did this season. Like you were saying, expectations were so low. I think initially there was a lot of fanfare about how maybe they would include certain things that would stick out just in terms of streaming versus traditional cable. Clearly we didn't get that. But like you're saying, there was no huge mishaps in terms of airing these games. That was a massive win for Amazon. Everything that's come out of Amazon saying how pleased they were, how excited they were with how smooth this season went. Big question I think going forward as we do see more and more games streamed here over the next several years, just how that of course then differs. Lots of questions about how Amazon might be able to incorporate more of its business, its prime business, into those broadcasts. But clearly NFL is a massive winner here. Super Bowl coming up like you said about 110 million people expected to watch. No slowing down in the NFL right now. I\n",

Overall, analysts are bullish on the tech sector despite recent headwinds. And Amazon has the highest percentage of buy ratings on the street. Let's just start with a little Amazon talk.nothing is out of their reach right now. It's still an AWS story, but they're into healthcare now. Streaming gets the most headlines, probably the slowest part of the story. Stock down 32 % in the last year, up 16%. A lot of upside ahead. Not clear what to make of this week's earnings report.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:after what we saw last week from Microsoft. One of the big worrisome headlines in that report from Microsoft was slowing growth going looking ahead for its Azure business. So that places a lot of questions just in terms of what we could hear from Amazon for AWS. We know that's so important there to their business. So any guidance there I think is really going to be key. But it's interesting when you take a look at those analyst ratings with Amazon, the largest percentage of buy ratings here on the street when it comes to some of those bigger tech name plays, clearly a huge focus will be on Amazon. Dave, I'm also closely watching Meta because we talked about the fact that Meta clearly one of the worst performers of the year looking back to 2020. It's hard to really see that changing when you take a look at the fundamentals at least of their business outside just a pure valuation play at this point. Clearly a tough road ahead. Losses in their reality labs segment that of course could actually exceed what they predicted exceed that 4 billion number. So that of course will be a focal point here in this reportlayoffs. We know layoffs is something we've heard from many of these companies except for Apple. So we'll see whether or not that changes.\n",

Yeah, Meta is the one that I still don't think they're through the woods yet. But if you look back to November, the stock's up more than 60 % since November 3rd. So investors feel otherwise. They're not through the Metaverse mess, right? They've still got some cost cutting, still probably some more layoffs. Amazon, we saw that chart. 93 % are bullish on it. How about Alphabet real quickly? 92 % of analysts are bullish on the case for Google parent Alphabet. And when it comes to them, two threats for me, AI, which obviously the chat GPT threat, some have now suggested this is a major threat to search. We're not going to see that on the earnings report. We probably won't hear about that in the call. But the threat of AI and the threat of anti -tech antitrust regulation from the government, those are the two things weighing on Alphabet.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:certainly. And massive challenges here for that tech giant ahead of these results. I think we might get a question or two from analysts about those things, because clearly when you look at the forward -looking picture here with Google, with Alphabet, a lot of those question marks about the second half of 2023 into 2024 really weighs heavily on those two huge issues, Dave, that you just brought up.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:not surprisingly, Apple is looking the best on my list here. But I just wanted to go over the performance of some of these mega caps. Now, this is the NASDAQ 100 year -to -date. So some high flyers here, especially in terms of the big names. We've got Amazon up 20%. We've got Meta up 23%. Tesla up almost 40%. NVIDIA up 32%. And this comes after a terrible year. Let's not forget that Meta had two quarters last year where they missed something by like 20%. Well, the price reaction was something like 20 % down the next day. So what I've done is I've looked at three stocks that are reporting this week. We've got Apple, Meta, and Amazon. And Apple, you can see, usually beats its number 91 % of the time. Now, you can see that. You'd think that'd be great and everything. But the one -day price percent change, that is going to 52%. So barely better than half. And this goes back 10 years. And the results are for all three of these. The results are all three skewed a little bit to the downside by what's happened over the last year. Now, sticking with Apple, the median EPS price is 4 .1%. So that's in terms of the earnings per share amount beat. And then the median one -day price change, 2 .1%. That is... Only the... For Apple, I got to say, that is actually pretty low. Throughout history, it has been higher at times. And then you do the same analysis for Meta and Amazon. Now, Meta, EPS beat 86%, notwithstanding what I was talking about, those misses over the last year. One -day percent price change, 52%. These numbers really don't square going down the mark. So I think what I want to say here is day traders, great. If you have this... If you have the opportunity to get involved in one of these trades after the bell, before the bell the next day, into the close, great. But this doesn't necessarily have predictive power about the stock. And that just has to do with the environment that we're in. One of the stats that I like to look at is options implied one -day price change. And that's done... That's signaled by the options market. So, for instance, for Apple, we're looking at an options market that is pricing in a 4 % price change after the fact. And what happens historically, usually only about half of that, 2 .1%. Meta, we're looking at an 8 % change. Amazon, looking at a 9%. So, my other conclusion is this is probably going to be a volatile week. And we're probably going to see some bigger reactions even in these big names than we would ordinarily.Jared. Good stuff. Thank you, my friend.\n",

Most Ford dealers will actually participate in a program that promises to pick your car up for service, drop it off when it's repaired.

      "SPEAKER_00:long -term sentiment on crypto is bullish among financial advisors, limited access and regulatory uncertainty concerns remain a pain point for greater crypto adoption in portfolios. Here with more of the details is Matt Hogan, Bitwise Asset Management CIO. Good to see you, Matt. So obviously, a lot of retail investors have a lot of concerns with the FTX fallout and everything else. But in terms of what you're seeing financial advisors, what they're hearing from clients, what's standing out to you right now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:the incredible thing, we just finished a survey of financial advisors, and they are hearing from clients. That's the incredible thing. Last year was such a massive pullback in the crypto markets. But we heard that 90 % of financial advisors fielded questions from clients about crypto. And the number one question was, should I invest? I think investors have seen this bull and bear market in crypto in the past. And they know that each time crypto is pulled back significantly, it's gone on to recover and move to all -time highs. So if you're in the crypto market, you're going to see a lot of people who are saying, should I invest? Should I invest? Should I invest? Should I invest? Should I invest? So financial advisors are hearing from clients, should we be exposed to that? And an increasing number of them are saying yes.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Matt, when we translate that interest into what we actually see in client portfolios, I mean, it is a low number, 15 % allocating in client accounts. And you attribute that mostly to access as well as some perhaps a bit of uncertainty as people try and figure out what's going to happen with this crypto environment.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:exactly right. More than half of the financial advisors we surveyed said they could not get exposure to crypto in the future. Maybe because they work for a firm that blocks it or there are regulatory hurdles for them. Among financial advisors who can allocate, more than 50 % do. And the reason is simple. You know, crypto is an incredible asymmetric return asset that you can put in portfolios in small amounts and have a large impact on that portfolio. It is the case that access is improving. You know, the number of national account platforms that Bitwise products are on tripled over the last year and increased. Recently, advisors are looking at things like crypto equity ETFs as an easier on ramp into the space. So access remains a major gating factor, but it's improving quickly. And that's going to bring the assets that financial advisors manage into the crypto space in the next year, two years and three years.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Matt, then for those who do have access but are still choosing not to invest, what are the biggest headwinds for them? What's giving them the most pause?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:it's funny. We've asked that question five years in a row. And the answer has been no. It's that they're trying to make sure that they're not giving them more time to invest. And the answer has been that they're more focused on investing in the crypto space than they are investing in the crypto space. So I think it's going to be the same regulation. Advisors want more regulation of the crypto space so they feel more secure, so their client assets are more secure. And that's actually an interesting insight for viewers. There are a lot of people out there who think the headlines around regulation in crypto are scary. Like every time the White House puts out a report or Congress takes steps, that's going to be a negative for the crypto market. the professional investing class into the market. And remember, financial advisors and institutions have about four times as much assets as retail investors. So this is a huge wave of money. When you see regulatory headlines around crypto, bias towards thinking that's a good thing and not a bad thing, and you'll be able to interpret how the market responds.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Matt, we know that one of the reasons that the government doesn't want to see crypto and things like 401k and other things is because really that explanation of risk, really understanding, because there's a lot of people out there with a lot of high valuations for where Bitcoin could go long term. A lot of that's still unproven at the moment. So then how soon do you think this will be a really great opportunity for financial advisors when you do still have so many policy headwinds in between?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:look, I think it's an incredible business development opportunity for financial advisors today, because right now their clients are doing it on their own. Remember, Coinbase has 100 million retail, accounts. When advisors ask clients if they're investing on their own, they said yes, those clients would do better if they brought the assets in house with the advisors so they could be managed in a professional fashion. The percentage of advisors who allocate to crypto and client accounts has been going up for the past five years. When we started this survey, only 4 % of financial advisors had allocations. Today it's 15. I think four years from now it will be over 50%. So it's coming. Regulation is coming. And the other thing that's going to be a big challenge for the And advisors need to educate themselves around the space to stay ahead of this trend.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Matt, we know that a lot of people switch to some of these hard wallets. They don't want to have another person managing their crypto. What's the selling point, then, for having a financial advisor versus keeping everything on your own hard wallet?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think there are valid instances of both. If you have incredible security hygiene as an individual and you're a really strong sort of institutionally oriented investor that you'll not panic and sell. You have a lot of people who are going to be out there, they're going to be able to when the market goes down, that you'll rebalance your portfolio, then absolutely do it on your own. But if you're not, if you're like 90 % of Americans who don't have days and weeks to dedicate to this yourself, you're probably better with a financial advisor surveying the market, finding the best product, deciding if you want to be in crypto equities or crypto assets like Bitcoin, and then using crypto in a portfolio the same way you use stocks and bonds and other assets. You don't need to think of it outside those bands. So sure, some investors will do well doing it themselves if they have that incredible security hygiene. But if not, trust an advisor to find a regulated partner who establishes funds in the markets, been doing it for a number of years, and go in that direction. They're both valid paths.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Matt, it does seem people are really playing the long game here. I mean, 60 % of the clients surveyed bullish on Bitcoin going up at that five -year point. And we are expecting, we're halving for Bitcoin to come in 2024. What do you think is going to be the triggering event for a bull running Bitcoin?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I actually think we're already in it. If you look at the returns this year, we're up more than 40%. I think we'll end the year higher than we are today. Crypto has historically moved in four -year cycles with three up years and one pullback year. We saw that again. 2022 was the pullback year. But there's a lot of exciting technological development. So I think we're in the new bull cycle. But when does it go back to all -time highs? That will take regulatory progress. It will take the passage of time. It won't be easy. I suspect it'll be volatile. But as you said, a large number of advisors think it's going in that direction over the next five years. I think that's a good time window. We will get there. We're already starting on that bullish path. And you can expect that to continue.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:definitely check back with you. See where Bitcoin goes. Obviously, anything can happen. Black's one of the best. We've got sings and other real estate high chips. People like Covid or what happens in the Ukraine and Russia can suddenly throw a wrench into things. A big thank you for joining me this morning, Matt Hogan, bitwise Asset Management CIO.

      "SPEAKER_00:the Fed isn't the only thing weighing on markets. The ongoing debate about the debt ceiling also has the potential to dampen sentiment. This, alongside recent economic data, is leading some economists to say there won't be a soft landing for the U .S., but also that the recession won't be as dire as some say. Joining us with more is Elliot Hentoff, head of policy research at State Street Global Advisors. Good to see you, Elliot. Obviously, a big stew of things. We are expecting some volatility ahead of this debt ceiling standoff, though I don't think anyone's actually expecting a default. But when you add that, with already uncertainty about when the Fed will pivot and perhaps bond markets pricing a little too much optimism, how should investors be looking at this period?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think we are in for an unfortunate alignment of circumstances with the debt ceiling crisis going to emerge when the macro data really takes a step south. So the bond market, as you pointed out, has been very optimistic. I just want to remind viewers here thatsummer or last spring, the bond market was forecasting the first rate cut now, yes, for February of 2023. And obviously, we're very far away from that. So I would caution viewers again to look at the bond market's assumptions and rethink whether, indeed, they think inflation and growth comes down at a pace that allows, gives political cover to the Fed to undo some of the rate hikes they've done already. Over the past year. Final word on the debt ceiling. What did I want to talk about? A lot of the macro data, yes, US economic data haspretty decent so far, particularly the fourth quarter of last year. But when you look at a lot of other indicators that are forward looking, it suggests we're about to head for a much stronger slowdown than anticipated.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:obviously, there's a lot of noise in the market with every data point that comes out. Which factors are you focusing on when you're trying to determine the path, not just that the Fed might take, but perhaps the sort of recession that might be ahead as well?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:there's no great mystery here. This is, this is, it's the usual, usual stuff. I would, I would say some of us economists look a little bit more at indicators that have had, let's say, a better track record in terms of forecasting recession. So if you look at jobs numbers, for instance, the continuing job claims have had a much better predictive power in terms of future economic cycles. For instance, we hit a critical threshold towards the end of the last year, which is thatjob claims are up only about 14 % off their lows. Now, that may not sound like much, particularly because in absolute numbers, they're still pretty low. But whenever those numbers have gone up, by that extent, that has usuallya recession, or put it this way, every recession has been preceded by that type of jump within the six to nine months beforehand. So again, that's just one example on the job. But if you look at inflation, if you disentangle the inflation numbers, you see that particularly wage related inflation is still very sticky services related inflation, very sticky does not look like the whole disinflation wave that is supposed to basically precede the rate cuts is really taking hold in critical areas of the inflation metrics.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:know, of course, the Fed will be keeping an eye on that employment data. But as we look at other central banks, what we've seen the ECB also coming out this week, as well as the Bank of England. How are those expectations different? Obviously, they have different pressures as a result of what they saw with their energy crunch?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:have divine intervention on the in support of their actions. What do I mean? Obviously, one thing we were all worried about was the nature of the winter in Europe and that obviously has passed, at least from an economic point of view passed incredibly well, well above expectations. So basically, it's, it's not an equal distribution curve of anybody, you know ,ian amount of options that West\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:fears of Bitcoin's price action pull into view. The digital assets long -term trend hangs in the balance as the Fed's next rate hike decision fast approaches. Here with more on what to watch for Bitcoin is Yahoo Finance's own Jared Brickery. Hey, Jared.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:there. It is all about the Fed. And while this is what's happened over the last 24 hours, let's get a quick look of what happened over the weekend. And why did I say all about the Fed when we're talking crypto? That is because crypto is very levered to the Fed's balance sheet and to its money printing operations, to monetary policy in general. So here's Bitcoin up a whopping half a percent over the last three days. But here's what it's done year to date. Now up almost 40%. We haven't seen a January like this since way back in 2013. And let me just show you what was happening back then. So this is a max chart. This goes back to what, 2009? Now back in 2013, you're not going to be able to see the line. We did have a huge run up for about four months, I believe. And is it going to look anything like this? Well, what I want to focus on is this huge peak that we had back here in 2017. That was a high of 20 ,000. Now they say markets have price history, price memory, excuse me. And we can see that playing out. In fact, we dip below 20 ,000. You might call this potentially a fall spread. Why false? Because if the direction is now up, that would be a little bit of a scare to the downside that we often see in technical trading here. Now, the point is we could be on the upswing here, but we have some obstacles. Now let me show you a Yahoo Finance chart. I pulled this from our website. A little bit of copy and paste here. And what I wanted to show here, this is a free indicator called volume profile. This tells you all the volume that has been transacted at a given price level. So this goes back two years. This is the top here at almost 79 ,000. And right here, this is 30 ,000. So this line right here is a huge area. And you can see indeed that most of the volume is concentrated between 30 and 60 ,000. Now, we're also coming off a very, very strong base. The fact that this line right here at 20 ,000 is this big probably means that that's a very good support. And we would not want to see that violated should prices come down again. Suffice to say, once we get above 25 ,000 should be smooth sailing to 30 ,000. But that's where the rubber meets the road. So this Wednesday with the Fed is going to be very important. As I said, these crypto assets tend to lead the Fed, tend to lead stocks and bonds more than anything else. It is what it is. So on Fed Day at 2 .30 p .m. when Chair Powell takes the lectern, I'm going to be watching Bitcoin to see where we might be ending the day with stocks.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:morning to you. That's right, a big week indeed. The Federal Reserve kicking off its first policy meeting of the year, Tuesday, where it is widely expected to slow down the pace of rate hikes while looking at how much further it needs to raise rates ultimately this year after three months of slowing inflation. Here are three things to watch. Number one, a 25 basis point rate hike. A chorus of Fed officials have signaled a quarter point rate hike at this meeting, which would mark a further slowdown in pace from the half a percentage point hike seen in December. Markets are pricing in a nearly 100%. Chance that this happens. That would bring the policy rate to a range of four and a half to four and three quarters, marking the highest level since October 2007. The Fed wants to slow down the pace of rate hikes to assess the impact on the economy so far and see how much higher they need to raise the policy rate to continue bringing down inflation.two, how much further will the policy rate rise and when could the Fed pause? Read the Fed's statement. And see whether they leave in language that quote ongoing increases in rates emphasis on plural there will be required.listen to comments from Fed Chair Powell during the press conference, since there won't be any new interest rate projections this meeting. Most Fed officials estimated in December that the policy rate would need to rise to a peak between five and five and a quarter, implying about two more quarter point increases.three, what does Fed Chair Powell say about fiscal year? Financial conditions. The Fed has said any easing in financial conditions will make it harder for them to do their job and could require further rate hikes. If you look at the yield on the 10 year Treasury and the level on the S &P, they're about roughly where they were mid -December, perhaps a hair higher when the Fed met last. Some officials have talked about the potential to raise rates even after the Fed pauses if financial conditions loosen or inflation remains high. Watch to see. Whether Fed Chair Powell will say the same thing. Now, Rochelle, I just want to point out one other major data point that Fed officials are closely watching tomorrow morning is the employment cost index. This is important because it is an indicator of wage growth, which they believe is feeding into inflation. Now, depending on where that number comes in, it probably won't change the calculus for a 25 basis point rate hike, but could have implications for how they see things going forward. Back to you.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:set to report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell. Yahoo Finance reporter Ali Kanal is here with what we can expect from the music streamer. Ali, what are you expecting?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Rochelle. And Spotify had a really rough 2022 with the stock losing more than two thirds of its value. And if you look at the stock performance since we saw that record high in February 2021, the stock is still down about 65%. So investors are really going to be focused on this earnings report to see if there are any improvements when it comes to profitability along with gross margins. Now, here are top and bottom line expectations. And reminder that Spotify does report in earnings estimates for revenue coming in at roughly 3 .2 billion euro on an adjusted loss of roughly 130 a share. Total monthly active users, that's expected to tick higher to reach 479 million. On a premium subscriber basis, those numbers expected to grow 7 million in the quarter to reach 200 million. And on a monthly basis, those numbers expected to grow 202 million with ad supported users estimated to come in at about 287 million. That would be a 14 million jump compared to Q3. But again, I think the main focus here is going to be on gross margins. Those numbers did disappoint in the third quarter, sending shares down about 13 % following the results. When it comes to Q4, those numbers are pretty muted in comparison to Q3. Current estimates calling for around 24 .5%. So anything less than that, you will likely see a major sell -off. And really, this is a narrative that Spotify has been grappling with for quite some time. Really solid top line growth, really solid subscriber numbers. But those medium to long -term investments, especially when we think about podcasting, that's just been hammering the bottom line. And investors, they don't have the patience for it anymore.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:mean, when you think about how podcasting especially blew up during the pandemic when people were under lockdown, different story now. So I mean, will Spotify be forced to pivot that growth at all cost strategy? I think it's going to be a big challenge. I think it's going to be a big challenge. I think it's going to be a big challenge. I think it's going to be a big challenge for Spotify in order to reach those profitability targets. That\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:seems to be the vibe over these past few weeks heading into earnings, especially after last week when we saw Spotify lay off 6 % of its workforce, restructure the business. Dawn Ostroff, who led that podcast division, she will now be stepping down. And it seems like Spotify is finally starting to understand that it's very expensive to create original programming. It's very expensive to lure these high profile celebrities for podcasting. I mean, if you look at some of these deals, we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars for deals with Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian. So there needs to be a better way. Spotify has been developing advertising technology for audio so it can take advantage of those ad dollars. The company did reiterate to Yahoo Finance that 2022 was that peak investment year and that in 2023, you'll start to see incremental improvements on profitability, on operating income. But this is going to be a long term effort and investors really, really want to see improvements. So I think we're going to see a pivot in this podcasting strategy. And I also think I know subscribers don't want to hear this, but I do think we could see some price hikes, especially with YouTube Premium and Apple Music recently hiking prices as well. So we'll see if we get any of those announcements on the earnings call tomorrow morning for Spotify Q4 results.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:new EV supply chain is coming online and the company is ramping up production of its Mustang Mach -E to help reduce customer wait times and take advantage of streamlined costs to reduce prices across the board. The move prices Ford's Mach -E more competitively against Tesla, which recently cut prices as well. For more on the EV market, let's go to Yahoo Finance's Praj Subramanian. Good for consumers, I know they like to hear these price cuts coming in.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:price cuts, but Rochelle, really the big news here is this is all in response to Tesla cutting prices of that Mustang Mach -E here. You know, from as little as $600 to $6 ,000 for certain models. You know, you have four models below that very, very, very important $55 ,000 IRA price tax cap that you need to get that big tax credit. So it's a huge deal for Ford there. Ford said in a statement, though, we're not going to cede ground to anyone. A very strong statement there because they're basically talking about Tesla there, right? So strong words, but will it be? Will it be enough to sort of compete? And like you mentioned, Ford also boosts production. They didn't say by how much, but I want to note that they sold around 40 ,000 Mach -Es last year. So I imagine looking to at least double that capacity by 2023.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:you know, people are always looking for things like new models. We haven't seen any new models from Tesla in a while. But then when you look at the prices, some of it might be apples to oranges depending on how different they are. But how do the prices for the new Mach -E compare to Tesla's vehicles?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:after the price cuts, the most compelling sort of trend is the one that's going to be the most competitive. And that's the trim here for the Ford Mustang Mach -E. It's called the E all -wheel drive premium model. That compares, that costs around $54 ,000. That compares very favorably to the standard Model Y long range, which is around the same price. Both are all -wheel drive. Both will qualify for that $55 ,000 price tax credit. So that's probably where the battleground is for Ford versus Tesla. But Tesla has a secret weapon in the sense that their seven -seat trim versions qualify for an $80 ,000 price cap for the IRA. So if you add that $4 ,000 seven -seater, trim selection for your Model I, you get that higher price cap for the tax cuts. And that means you can buy more expensive versions of Tesla's cars, which are then better for Tesla from a margin point of view.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:keeping that in mind, sort of doing the math here to work out what ends up better for you and your tax breaks. Also want to talk Toyota. Still selling more cars than anyone else. What's the story there?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:you know, globally they eked out a win over Volkswagen. Now I think it's the third year in a row they've been the number one car seller in the world. It's sort of like a, it's a good thing to kind of have as a feather in your hat. But when we're talking about margin shrinking component crises, it's actually hard to sort of execute and get that, take that crown away. So, you know, Volkswagen is sort of coming on their heels. And Toyota had to actually, they've changed up their CEO. They switched over CEOs now because they're kind of behind the game in terms of EVs. They haven't been selling them in EVs at all. But they sell a lot of hybrids, which are very competitive, very, very in demand for consumers still. So in a good spot for Toyota here. But I think that down the line, I don't think they really want to be that number one model, the number one, you know, builder. Because it's too much pressure there to actually perform when you're trying to actually boost prices and boost margins in this kind of changing world in autos.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:eyes are on Apple this week as the $2 trillion company releases its first quarter earnings report. Investors and analysts will be looking to see just how much the recent COVID lockdowns in China's iPhone city have disrupted production. Layoffs across the tech sector have rocked an already jittery Wall Street, and while Apple has so far managed to avoid eliminating jobs this year, investors are bracing for a tough report. Wall Street isn't anticipating much to celebrate, as it expects Apple to post lower earnings and revenue than it did a year ago. Apple's stock price has outperformed much of its big tech competitors over the past year. As of January 27th, it's down about 8 % in the past 12 months, while Microsoft's share price is down 17 % and Google parent Alphabet is down 23%. But despite Apple's performance relative to the broader tech sector, shareholders voted to cut CEO Tim Cook's pay by more than 40 % to $49 million this year, a move quickly followed by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who also announced a pay cut following his company's decision to lay off 12 ,000 of its employees. And to its credit, Apple has managed to avoid large -scale layoffs, unlike its peers, partly because Apple's headcount grew at a slower pace than other tech giants over the course of the pandemic. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's workforce grew by 20 % between September 2019 and September 2022. During that same period, Microsoft's headcount increased 53%, Meta's 94%, and Amazon's workforce more than doubled. And that rapid growth, experts say, is what's driving cutbacks across the industry.\n",

Throughout November and December of 2022, Apple faced significant headwinds from COVID lockdowns and worker protests at manufacturer Foxconn's facility in Zhangjiao, China. The plant, which employs 200 ,000 workers, produces the bulk of Apple's total. The company's iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max handsets.

They're the only ones that have been able to get the most out of this year's market But it's not just the iPhone that's faced trouble. During Apple's Q4 earnings call, Apple's CFO Luca Mastri said that Apple expects nearly 10 percentage points of negative year -over -year impact from the strong dollar. What's more, Mastri said he expects Mac revenue to decline substantially year -over -year, and expects services revenue to grow but face those currency challenges as well. And while many investors sense trouble for Apple and others in the tech sector, some are seeing signs of optimism in the months ahead.\n",

Finances and S4A got to speak to some of these traders who were reflecting on the meme stock craze and probably not feeling so good about it, huh, Inez?\n",

I will say that one Reddit user reached out, anonymous link to me, said, look, I bought 100 shares of AMC at around $8 .50, then he sold them at $35 and $55. He saw this cult -like phenomenon building around GameStop and AMC. But then I spoke to another retail trader who sells stock -related merchandise online, and he said that he bought AMC thinking it would be the next Tesla. He said to me, I was so stressed, I lost so much money that my wife threatened to divorce me. Now, luckily, they're still together. They went through that rough patch. But nonetheless, look, some people definitely lost money with this. We reached out to Vander Research that showed us this chart that you're seeing right there. And that's a net buying for GME, AMC, and Bed Bath & Beyond since January of 2021. The peak for GME was around January 27th of 2021, the day before some brokerage firms had temporarily halted. The buyback. And then we saw a big button, remember, for GME and some other stocks as well. Certainly, these stocks have gone through volatility in 2021, 2022 as well. Will we see another meme wave the way we've seen with these going forward? Well, I spoke to Vander Research and said, look, we struggle to see how that will happen, to how these levels will be revived to those 2020, 2021 levels, mainly because stimulus checks are gone. You've got a tighter monetary policy. Most retail trader portfolios are down about 35 % on average. And they've noticed that. The DL has worsened. Activity has also waned as well.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:.S. employees are getting more disgruntled. A recent Gallup poll finding that employee engagement, which had its first year -rear dip in a decade in 2021, fell again last year, going from 36 % in 2020 to 34 % in 2021, and then falling to 32 % in 2022. This is for full -time and part -time employees. The poll also finding that 18 % of workers are actively disengaged at work, and active disengagement actually ticked up six points since 2020. The ratio of engaged to actively disengaged workers is at the lowest rate that we've seen since 2013. And Dave, this is concerning when you take into account workers right now. Employers are doing everything they can to keep the workers that they have because of the fact that the labor market is so competitive. It's hard to hire for the jobs that you need, and those quit rates keep rising. They're incredible when you take a look at that. The labor market, what those numbers are on a month -over -month basis, and this is a very worrisome trend for employers.\n",

The expectations of workers are different now, and employers have no idea what to do with that. It's not simply using buzzwords that HR passed down to them to pass on to their employees. They have to actually engage those employees to create a different atmosphere and to acknowledge the fact that mental health now is of utmost importance. At first glance, Shauna, my guess was this was largely generational. It is the best correlation. Young people are more burnt out or more disengaged than old people because their expectations are frankly different than older people who worked 20, 30 years ago and have a different expectation. It's not as simple as remote work versus fully in office, though. And that was surprising to me. The biggest correlation was among those people whose jobs could be fully remote, but were actually fully back in the office. That was the most disengaged group.

You can see it nearly doubled in price, still up almost 50 percent. And that was the first time we've seen a lot of green. That was after seven volatility halts in the news. The Saudi private public investment fund thinking of buying out the EV maker, the Tesla competitor. They already own two -thirds of it. And while we haven't heard any rumors of funding secured just yet, if this sounds a little bit familiar, guess what? The Saudis were the ones who were supposedly about to buy Tesla back in the day. And we know how that trial is ongoing right now. Suffice to say, this is a SPAC that came to market under a lot of excitement. Got caught up in the meme stock mania. Here it is today, up 33 percent, guys.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:now for old people talking about Gen Zers. Adobe is out with a new survey talking about Gen Z in the workplace. Gen Z expected to account for 30 % of the US workforce by 2030, that's according to Adobe. And they have unique challenges ahead of them with fears of a recession and the pandemic -led rise in remote work. 70 % surveyed say they are worried about a recession. Many of the college students and recent grads say they are saving money ahead of a possible downturn.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Dave, those macroeconomic factors are clearly having an impact because 67 % in this survey say that those macro factors have influenced or will influence their job choice when it comes to picking an industry or a company. 55 % will look at a company's financial outlook before applying. 85 % say that they're less likely to apply without a job. And 75 % say that they're more likely to apply without a job. And that's a very popular topic of discussion. This one, though, is a little surprising. Considering the appeal of remote work, 75 % say that they would be willing to relocate to be closer to work. Clearly, they're emphasizing that Gen Z does see a value of coming into the office. I think the big question there is how many days they really want to come into the office. Most likely, they probably want some sort of hybrid situation. Another stat that did stick out to me was this startup. And how only 60 % of office workers are going to work. And 16 % saying that they would pursue a role with a startup or a small -sized company. Now, I'm a millennial, but I know there was so much excitement when I came out of college of people wanting to work in a startup. And that was in the middle of the recession, of the Great Recession. Still, startups were attractive. A lot of people found that the growth that you could have there, the experience that you could get, it was willing to take that risk. That certainly does not seem to be the case now. Maybe they learned from our mistakes.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Without any recessionary fears. And, of course, I'm the Gen X here. As far as the being willing to relocate closer to a job, I think young people, regardless of what generation they're labeled with, they don't have a lot of attachments. They don't really care to be home all the time. In fact, they want a more social environment. They want to have happy hour. So that probably all lends itself to being in the office. And hopefully, they want to learn in their first job. Because that is all you want to do in that first job is really learn for the job that comes after it. As for the rest of that entire survey, I'm curious to see how that changes over the next 12 months. Because if, in fact, their recessionary fears do come true, they won't be as empowered as clearly they are in that survey. They won't have those choices. They won't have that flexibility. They won't have the strength to argue for these things. So that is really a representation of how tight the labor market is right now. And that dynamic may soon change. I think really the most interesting trend we're seeing among that group is wages. And I think that's going to be better for all of them and, quite frankly, I hope for all of us.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Yeah, I think so too. And I also think it's important to point out that those salary ranges, while there has been increased transparency, some of the ranges that are posted are mind -boggling. There was one, what, $90 ,000 to $900 ,000. Didn't really do you any favors just in terms of narrowing down what you should be paid or what you could be paid in that role. But again, I think the step towards more salary transparency and people also, especially the younger generation, are more prone to talking about it. They think you should be talking about salary transparency. So again, a huge focal point here for Gen Z when they're looking for a job.\n",

A new study from Smart Asset ranking all 50 states from lowest to highest income needed to be in that top 1 % of each state. Coming in at number one, your home state, Dave, Connecticut. You have to make around $955 ,000 to be in the top 1 % of taxpayers there. Connecticut is followed by Massachusetts, New Jersey, my home state, New York, and California. In all of these states, you need to make over $800 ,000 a year to be considered in that top 1%.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:goodness, those are astounding numbers for ordinary Americans just watching this. $900 ,000. And when I look at that top five, there's really a fundamental disconnect that I see. It's really untethered from what you would assume, because my assumption would be that these would be highly performing economies. Not at all the case. I love my state. Connecticut is a wonderful place to live. However, at best, it's middle of the pack. U .S. News has it as the 22nd ranked economy in the United States. Now, California is the one that stands out to me. Massachusetts, a pretty solid economy. California, no, in the top 10. But New York and New Jersey. New Jersey is the 33rd overall ranked economy, according to U .S. News. And New York is 43rd. So, again, really untethered to the success. And the size of that state's economy shows how giant the wealth gap is in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, the tri -state area.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Yeah, certainly a massive wealth gap. And like you're saying, when you compare it to the average, what Americans are making, the average American household earns a median income of under $70 ,000. So, $70 ,000 compared to over $900 ,000, the top 1 % in your state. Obviously, a massive, massive gap there.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:And Connecticut, I mentioned their economy losing Lego headquarters today to Massachusetts, one of those states. And the top 1 % in the state is the United States, on the list. Since most of us cannot relate to those numbers, let's look at the other end of the income bracket. And, well, still pretty hard to relate to these numbers as well. But these are the bottom five, depending on how you look at it. The top 1 % states Kentucky, Arkansas, New Mexico, Mississippi, and West Virginia is number one or number 50, depending on how you look at it. But still, to be in the top 1 % in West Virginia, $375 ,000 a year. Now, on the flip side of my observation with the top five, these are really tethered to, largely speaking, underperforming economies. West Virginia, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas, all in the bottom 10 of that U .S. News ranking of states' economies. Those are states that have been struggling, economically speaking, for a number of years. So that, on the bottom end, makes a little bit more sense. Still, an extraordinary amount of money.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:certainly is. And less than 10 % of all households earn more money. And that's more than $200 ,000, which is far below West Virginia there, which ranked fifth, which is just below $400 ,000. So, clearly, there is a massive disconnect, a massive wealth gap, like you were talking about when you compare really all 50 states. What we're seeing, the average numbers there, comparing that to the average household, the American household, what they take home every year. It's no surprise that so many Americans are being hurt so drastically by inflation and with no relief really in sight. It's a very, very tough economy. It's a tough economy here for at least the next couple of quarters. I'm\n",

Where may investors be looking to, and where may the market be headed? We're here to discuss this with Neil Shah, Edison Group Director of Research. Good to see you, Neil. So, as we're seeing here, I mean, this is a better queue for earnings season so far, as you said in your note, than you expected. But what do you attribute that to?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:think that the consumer has been more robust than a lot of people feared, particularly around the holiday season, and it varies by region. So you're seeing signs that actually Europe has fared a lot better than perhaps the US has. And last time I was on the show, I think there was a lot of nervousness about how much money the stock market had, and then it was a lot of nervousness our Q4 ended. We've come into January, a lot of companies reporting actually positive trading updates. And I think that that's being reflected in a buoyant market that we're seeing today.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:you are saying that we're currently in a sweet spot between easing inflationary pressures and corporate earnings potentially deteriorating. So then how should investors approach this period?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:it's tricky. I mean, I think this year is going to be a tricky year for investors. I was reading one investment houses note and their assessment was that the portfolio you want for the next six to nine months is very different to the portfolio you want for a decade of investing. And you've got to make up your mind how long term you want to be in your positioning.Right now, what we're seeing is that all the sectors that kicked you in 2022 have been kissing you in 2023. Whether you want to be in those stocks long term, I think is a big question mark. So we've seen a rotation out of, for example, consumer staples into consumer discretionary. There might be some good reasons for that. We can talk about some of the themes we're looking at. But I think that you need to be reasonably nimble as we are in this market. You can participate in the market. And I think you want to be rotating in and out of sectors.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Neil, speaking of those key themes that you've got to address, I think we're going to be watching this year, baby boomers wealth, geopolitical tensions, industrial automation, natural resources and oil. Which one do you think has, I guess, the most propensity to do the most damage to markets or to really shift the narrative this year?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:think, look, there's, you know, my view is that the winners of the last decade will be very different to the winners of the next decade. I think we're seeing a pivot in the market.started to see that. We're seeing that rotation out of, you know, long duration growth stocks as rates started going up into old school economy names, particularly companies with real assets, cash flowing businesses, people looking for dividend yields and, you know, old school industrial names where the valuations are slightly more attractive. Now, looking forward, some of the things that I would look to play are that I don't think, I think that you're going to see a lot of growth in the market. You're going to find upside surprises in certain sectors. So let's let's touch on this idea of, you know, you've seen actually consumer discretionary, particularly in Europe, outpaced consumer staples. One of the things that we're starting to see is that the baby boomer generation who is coming up for retirement is a massive pool of wealthnot necessarily passing it on to the next generation. I think this this Covid impact has meant that people are looking to treat themselves, spoil themselves a little bit. And you're starting to see. You're starting to see them spend on some of the top performing sectors. So, you know, travel, leisure has done reasonably well. And that's a theme that I think you can start to you may look to play. I think it's early days. So you want to see some points validating that. But luxury goods, for instance, is an area where I think there's quite a lot of interest. I also think that the geopolitical environmentone which is going to persist. You know, we've got this. There's this situation in Russia. China's coming out of its lockdown. But I think that's going to remain an issue for the markets over the next 12 months. And one of the things I think policymakers are going to be focusing on more than ever is energy security. And one of the things we're looking to play is the switch of energy from east to west to actually north to south. So the fields, the energy fields in Africa and northern Europe. Start to take much more of a strategic importance. And we're starting to look for points of value in companies operating in these areas. So I think I think it's very much the nature of what I'm discussing is it's a stock pickers market. You need to find interesting long term themes that are going to contribute to growth that outpaces inflation, that offsets a depressed demand environment.it's worth participating in the market. But I don't think that you could just buy. A general ETF. I think you'll struggle if you do that. I think you need to find interesting plays in the market.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:it sounds like a more targeted approach, as you're mentioning there. And I want to talk about a trend that you mentioned because you're talking about this orderly deflation of assets that we're going to see. We saw it last year with tech and some of these longer duration ones. But this year you're expecting private equity and real estate to be more in focus. How do you see that unfolding?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:mean, you know, it's the Warren Buffett thing. It's the The The The The TheThe The The You know, that's the thats a some boring. That's probably not gonna be gonna be very popular. But I mean, for real estate. Really,it's a really good line. It's a similar, uh, kind of其實 like marinery. So yeah, we're still, there's the political risk trade itself just inner immediately off of the here. Okay. And Richard, what's it going to look like next? Interesting. more broadly in the commercial real estate sector. And again,focus on are you going to start to see the possibility of some write -downs in that sector? The main thing I'd focus on is that it's not panic. I think it's an orderly adjustment of valuations to a new environment. And I would, for the reasons I've set out, I'd be cautious about those two sectors because I think those are going to come into focus this year.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:the price of eggs increases here in the U .S., so do the attempts to bring raw eggs and poultry across the U .S.-Mexico border. And that's according to the U .S. Customs and Border Protection. Our Brooke DePalma is here with the details. Didn't see this coming. This was not on my 2023 bingo card.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:was not on the bingo card for me either, Rochelle. Of course, the price of eggs are up 59 .9 % year over year, up 11 .1 % month over month in December of 2022, according to the latest CPI data. And it turns out people are doing all that they can to get eggs for cheaper. In a statement to Yahoo Finance from a U .S. Customs and Border Protection official in El Paso, he said, quote, We are seeing an increase in people attempt to cross eggs from Juarez to El Paso because they are, quote, unquote, significantly less expensive in Mexico. than the U .S. This is also occurring with added frequency at other southwest border locations as well. And he said while many headlines are saying that travelers are smuggling the raw eggs and poultry, he said most are actually declaring them during the primary inspection without consequence. Now, if, however, they are discovered during an inspection, that's when a $300 civil penalty comes into play, and they are then seized from the traveler. But that's not all. But another U .S. border official tweeting over the weekend in San Diego that in response to not declaring those eggs prior to an inspection, they can result in penalties up to $10 ,000. Now, of course, this comes as the toll of the avian flu outbreak is causing those prices to soar here in the U .S. Per the USDA, a total of 57 million birds have been wiped out, resulting in those higher prices that we're seeing across the U .S. Of course. Some stores even seeing as high as $6, even maybe $7 to $8 for just a dozen of eggs.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:well, at least the lesson here is declare them. You know, don't end up paying more in fines than you would for the eggs in the first place. So then, Brooke, will Americans expect to see relief anytime soon?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:according to the USDA, inventory is on the rise, and therefore prices should then fall. Of course, this is going to take time. As I'm speaking to farmers across the U .S., they really say that because they had to, unfortunately, destroy part of their fleet, part of those laying hens that produce these eggs, it'll take into perhaps the second half of 2023, even into 2024 in order to restock that fleet of egg -laying hens and then ultimately get more eggs produced and to market. And therefore, when we see that happen, then the egg prices will fall. So it's not going to happen right away, Michelle. We may see more wonky. We may see more wonky stories like this happen as Americans look to cut corners. But as of right now, it's going to take time.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:business taxes are set to rise even as the economy shows some weakness. This according to a new report from Fox Business. Now, changes to federal taxes are set to begin in 2023 with a 15 percent profit based minimum tax on corporations set to begin this year. And that's part of the Inflation Reduction Act. So with many of the changes happening this year, the effects won't be reflected and likewise won't necessarily come due in this year's 2022 tax season.let's continue the conversation now because tax season is approaching. But where are all the accountants? The Wall Street Journal reporting a nationwide shortage of the profession to cope. Firms like Geltrude and Company are hiring overseas workers. Well, joining us with more is Dan Geltrude. Geltrude Company founder. Good to see you, Dan. So did you ever imagine we would get to this point? How did we get here?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I didn't. And really, my firm is nothing special in this regard. In that we're at a point where it's not just about our ability to grow as a firm. It's about being able to handle the current workload. Over the last two years, 300 ,000 accountants have left the profession. So that leaves a huge hole here to be filled. And as you know, regulations and rules just keep increasing. So there's more responsibilities on accountants. To get their work done. Yet we have significantly less people to do the work. So it's really become a problem. And the solution really is twofold. First, more useto the greatest extent possible. And then an international solution in trying to bring people on board that can help supplement our U .S. workers.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:then, Dan, as we talk about technology, then, is it about getting more assistance for current accountants? Or is it about more reliance on some of these apps and these other services that are becoming available?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think what's happening here is there is a level of work that certainly can be automated and technology can step into that. However, there is always a human factor in terms of reviewing the work. And then also there's that consultation piece with clients. It's about strategizing. And that's something that you really can't replace with technology. So there's certainly still a huge demand for accountants throughout the country. It's just a matter of how you use those resources and then how you supplement that with technology along with international help.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Dan, you call this a crisis and a real threat to capitalism. Why are accountants so concerned? Why are they retiring so quickly? And how might we see this play out?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:let me go straight to what the potential crisis is. So if you don't have enough accountants to get all the work done, as well as auditors, how does that play out? Well, first and foremost, you start to say, okay, can all the tax returns that need to be filed on a timely basis, can all that work get done? The second piece of that, and perhaps even more potential for that, is that you have to be able to get all the work done. And the reason why you have to go for damage to the U .S. financial system is what happens if you don't have enough auditors in order to be able to timely file all the SEC filings for all these public companies? Because once there is a crack in the credibility of the work being performed, the timeliness and the quality of the work, what happens? Investors start to question whether they can rely on the financial information that they're seeing for what they're doing. Well, what happens essentially is the smaller firms actually do employee crucified铆 in, and it's probably under helping out the clients and getting them on top of the data that are actually looking at system development and what makes the investment decision more effective than what the company is That's when you're starting to get the attention of\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:you say is most at risk? Is this a smaller firms more at risk of this versus some of these bigger institutional companies?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:actually, it's across the board, whether it's a large international firm or you're smaller local firms, everybody is feeling already tied with the banking tighter, the experience considered. the same pain. So clients are clients. The big firms have big clients and public companies. Certainly, it's a threat there, as I just outlined, related to SEC filings. And then as you go down to the local firms, you expect that your accounting firm or your tax preparer is going to be able to get your taxes filed on time or filed at all. Maybe they just simply can't take on more work. So large or small, this problem has the potential to impact everyone.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Dan, I know we talk solutions perhaps when it comes to technology, but what about sort of overseas hiring as well? Would that be enough to offset the risk of the shortage of accountants here?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:it's certainly part of the solution. Is it 100 %? No, because what you also have is, there's so much hiring going on internationally, we're starting to get to the point where, are there even enough accountants around the globe? So again, I don't know why people are not drawn to the accounting profession. It's certainly a great profession and a very honorable profession. However, it just seems that people are shying away from it.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:mean, to be fair, it doesn't sound like the most glamorous of professions, especially, you know, you see everyone on TikTok, you don't really hear them gravitating towards accountancy, but there you go. There are over 100 ,000 people who are doing it. And I think that's clearly the people should be paying attention to. Dan Geltrude, always good to have you.

Senior columnist Rick Newman taking on that claim in this week's Bidenomics. Rick, good to see you, sir. Are people buying it?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:they are a little bit. We saw an increase or an improvement in consumer confidence this week. I don't think that's because Biden is telling people they can afford to be more confident. I think it's a reaction to falling inflation. But things are looking pretty good. I mean, just go back a year. What we know about how the year began in 2022, we had two quarters in a row where GDP actually contracted a little bit. Some people thought that meant a recession had arrived. But that's not what happened in 2022. Growth for the year came in at 2 .2%. Biden gave a speech this week on the economy. And he said, look, practically, since I came into office, Wall Street analysts have been saying, oh, a recession is coming. A recession is coming. A recession is coming. We've talked about this a million times. And it hasn't. So a recession is not here. Now, what happens with this narrative in 2023? I think Biden's got a kind of window of opportunity here for about three months. But there are a lot of signs that economic data is going to fall. And I think that's going to fall. And I think that's going to fall. And I think that's going to fall. And I think that's going to fall. And I think that's going to fall. And I think to weaken in the first and second quarter of 2023, it's different from a year ago, obviously, because interest rates are higher. That is going to slow the economy. We're getting some forecasts for the first quarter of 23, the one we're in right now, that are around minus 1 .5%, so a shrinking economy. But look, we're not going to get that news until late April.

And what do we know about this?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:saying, but there are two apparent things going on here. So today, Elon Musk met with White House officials probably to talk about electric vehicles and in particular the rollout of a lot of the incentives for green energy, EVs and other types of things, charging network across the country that were in the Inflation Reduction Act that passed over the summer. I think this is important because there was a spat between Elon Musk and President Biden for a while there. Because every time Biden talks. He talked about electric vehicles and EV automakers. Mainly, he talked about General Motors and Ford, and he almost never mentioned Tesla, which really put Elon Musk in a foul mood toward Biden. He called him he called Biden a damp sock puppet on Twitter about a year ago. You know, one of the one of the more interesting Elon Musk tweets and there have been many. And he was really just irked that Biden would really not give Tesla any credit. And, you know, I think Elon Musk was kind of right about that. I mean, Tesla has still is the leading electric vehicle maker in the United States and some could argue in the world. And Biden would get up and talk about GM and Ford because they have unionized plants and Tesla does not have unionized plants. So maybe Elon Musk meeting with the Biden administration is a little bit of rapprochement there. And yesterday, Elon Musk went met with Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House speaker, and probably talked about Twitter and this whole issue of whether Twitter has been tweeting conservatives. And I think it would be a good thing to have Twitter as part of the conversation. But I also think that they have been tweeting conservatives unfairly. I do not think Twitter has been treating conservatives unfairly. I think what Twitter did before Elon Musk bought it was they banned the people with the most outrageous comments and many, many of those turned out to be conservative. So we'll see what Elon Musk is doing there. And that, you know, there are many developments ongoing here. We've been talking about them all week. So I can go on and on about Elon Musk.

And we know how that trial is ongoing right now. Suffice to say, this is a SPAC that came to market under a lot of excitement. Got caught up in the meme stock mania. Here it is today, up 33 percent, guys.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:as we continue with what just happened, lots of food for thought. So, Dan, where is your focus for tech in the coming weeks? I\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:a lot of what we have to look at is not just how the services side of things is doing. Obviously, we've discussed Microsoft because of their earnings. We're looking forward to Alphabet and Meta to see how the ad market's going. But I think the bigger question really is Apple's earnings coming up because they're a pure play consumer company. I mean, yes, they have a business side of things where companies like ours will purchase MacBooks. But the vast majority of what they do is sell to consumers. And I think that's going to give us a better sign of where the consumer actually feels they are right now as far as comfort level. Right. The idea of the PC market slowing down. OK, you know, people hold on to their PCs for five, seven years or until it starts spitting dust out the back of it. But I think the iPhone, the sales of things like. I've had this signs up for signups for services. I think that's going to give us a better indication than the PC market itself.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I mean, we also have Google's and Google Alphabet's earnings that are going to be coming out as well, February 2nd. And I mean, we have to keep in mind that even though people are they're laying off at the moment, doesn't mean that this speaks necessarily to the health of some of these companies, but perhaps see them more strategically really allocating this capital to other parts of their business. And I know you tapped on a lot of the nuances within the companies. All of them are having that. Thank you. We have to be tentatively more supportive, right? On that. Thank you so much, Michael. And if you're going to be seeing that, Matt, I've heard, not for a long time what they're dealing with is a matter of �e things later, but if they, of course, could just as possible, I think the As you look closely at, you know, the financial structure of some of these companies, we've seen that these there are places that there's obviously still a future. A lot of big tech companies are still hiring just a lot more strategically as they were during the pandemic\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:I think, you know, I mean, personally, I have a bunch of friends who got into coding during the pandemic. They're still able to find jobs, no problem. So I think that's going to be, you know, the sector is hurting. But does that mean that there's no jobs out there? No, there's other industries that need these people, not just the tech industry. There are tech jobs outside of the tech industry, for sure.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:true. Big tech gets all the headlines, but obviously jobs of the future attach to these other industries that still need tech as well.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:BLICKERY, Welcome back to What Just Happened Now on Yahoo Finance. I'm Jared Blickery. And guess what? We're watching job losses mount in the tech sector. But what if tech is now? Who's next? And already we're seeing hints of what's to come with blue chip companies like Dow and 3M announcing layoffs and even toy makers like Hasbro cutting back on staff. So I prepared some graphics today and I did a deep dive into the using the BLS, that's the Bureau of Labor Statistics own data and that's the data that we report on on a monthly basis coming to you next Friday for those January numbers. Stay tuned for that. But I've started with some of the places where we see the job losses first. Now these are not, well, startups and high growth is actually not a BLS category. It encompasses a number of other ones. But I put that in there because we've all seen those big tech headlines, some of those companies that were raising so many employees or increasing their headcount last year. shedding that today but in general we're seeing that in manufacturing now in manufacturing that can can that can cover many of the sectors that we're typically looking at when we talk about stocks so that could be a PC manufacturer could be Hasbro it could be toys could be anything construction as well that has to do with the housing sector and then the wholesale trade that's before these products reach the retail market so all of these tend to be indicators early on and those will often predate what we call the recession now some housekeeping notes here recession as broadly defined by Enber that's a National Bureau Bureau of Economic Research they're the ones who officially declare a recession but it's always with hindsight so we don't know in real time if we're actually in one and when we say recession that's including the entire entire American economy which is a huge huge place so within some of these sectors we can get a more nuanced view of what's going on so these are this is where we're seeing those early stage losses now in the mid stage we're going to see the recession and then we're going to see the recession and we're going to see that finally trickle down into retail in a financial services into professional services so we kind of went from some of the blue collar as well as some of the white collar jobs because that would be chip manufacturing as well into the white collar jobs although white collar and blue collar could be involved in retail trade so you can see there's a real mix of different types and categories that we're talking about here now at this stage pretty much we already know we're in a recession and typically I was talking about the recession overall for the economy we would first slip into what's called an industrial recession and an earnings recession. So two quarters of negative earnings back to back, and this might be the first quarter of those, would be an earnings recession. That usually predates the general recession. And also that industrial recession that I was talking about generally occurs somewhat in line with that earnings recession. Now, in the late stage, I actually have all these categories here. And in fact, I could further subdivide those into two categories. So in what I would call the safe industries, and those are the industries that tend to get hit the least or even counter cyclical, that would be education and health, government and utilities. Now, in these industries, sometimes we see an effect late in the game that could be after the recession has already ended. And sometimes with government spending, we see that increase. The amount of employees will increase into a recession. And that's politicians and Congress trying to make sure that the economy doesn't head. Into recession or recovers from it more quickly. So that would be a fiscal response here. But in the late stage, private sector, leisure and hospitality, information, mining and lodging, those all tend to get hit less. Now, I should also make the point that we all have different conceptions of recessions based on what we've experienced in our own lifetimes. And in fact, every recession is different. All of us remember the pandemic recession. And in fact, that hit leisure and hospitality the hardest. And that's when everybody took their lumps all at once. Basically going back to March 20th and the economy covered very, very quickly. For the most part, I don't even include that in a lot of my analysis because it was so abrupt and so uncharacteristic. Now, I want to show you the last two recessions before that. This goes back all the way to 1999. So this shows the dot -com bubble bursting as well as the global financial crisis that was more oriented toward the financial sector and also the housing sector. So just going along here, manufacturing and construction. So this shows the dot -com bubble bursting as well as the global financial crisis that was more oriented toward the financial sector and also the housing sector. So just going along here, manufacturing and construction. Those tend to get hit the most. Manufacturing is this line right here. And you can see before the recession started, in fact, in 1999, 2000, barely climbed back to positive. Manufacturing had been in secular decline for a couple of decades. Construction, another one that I was mentioning, oftentimes gets pretty hard hit. And then for all the hubbub about the financial services over the global financial crisis, it did not experience as great a dip as some of these other sectors. Although for financial services, it was still a dip. But for the financial services, it was uncharacteristically deep. And then this orange line here is hospitality. And you can see it's actually faring pretty well through both of these recessions, not getting hard hit as some of the others. And as I said, we all know that leisure and hospitality happen to get hit the most. So everything is going to be different. But it gets back to the question, where are we at this stage in the game? Everything, all the industries have inflected downwards. All these categories that I've been talking about inflected downwards. They've already peaked in terms of employment. As of last year. Two of those have not, but those have to do with the government industry. So a little bit of footnote right there.we going to plunge into recession? That's a big question here. We're seeing job losses accelerate to the downside. But we haven't even seen them crack the 1 % level. So none of these industries that I've been talking about here has even gone negative just yet. So a little bit of time there. Is that going to happen? That's a big question. And that's what we're going to be talking about in the future. And also, none of this has to do with the economy. It has to do with stock timing. So that's going to be up next, perhaps for next Friday, guys.thank you for at least breaking down the signals that people should be looking for if we do start seeing layoffs in those sectors. Great stuff. Jared Blickery there for us.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE GUIDANCE THAT WE GAVE IS CLEARLY THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY IN PARTICULAR THE PC MARKET WORKS, SASE, Q3 AND Q4 ARE GENERALLY BUIED BY HOLIDAY REFRESH AND BACK TO SCHOOL PURCHASE CYCLES. SO CUSTOMERS COMING OFF OF LITERALLY FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF SHORTAGES, RIGHT, CARRIED MORE INVENTORY INTO THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THEY BURNED INVENTORY IN Q3. THEY BURNED INVENTORY IN Q3. THEY BURNED INVENTORY IN Q4. BUT STILL HAD HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS AS THEY FINISHED THE YEAR. Q1, THOSE NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY. IN FACT, IT'S THE LARGEST INVENTORY TURN, BURN IN RECORDED HISTORY FOR US. WE CAN'T SEE ANY PERIOD WHERE THEY'RE MAKING SUCH DRAMATIC ADJUSTMENTS. WE'RE, OF COURSE, WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. BUT THEY'RE, YOU KNOW, THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE SELLING IN IS DRAMATICALLY BELOW WHAT THEY'RE SELLING OUT AS THEY BURN THROUGH INVENTORY.

YOU KNOW, SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT, HEY, FIRST HALF, YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY RUGGED AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PERIOD OF TIME. BUT EVERYBODY IS PREDICTING SOME LEVEL OF RECOVERY AS THEY NEED TO BUY TO, YOU KNOW, THEIR SELL -THROUGH RATES AND SOME LEVEL OF MARKET RECOVERY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

WE SET A RANGE OF 270 TO 295, WE BELIEVE, AT THE LOWER END. BUT THE SELL -IN RATE IS DRAMATICALLY BELOW THAT. THAT'S WHY WE SAY AT SOME POINT, THEY JUST GOT TO START REPLENISHING TO THE SELL -THROUGH RATE. THE OTHER BIG FACTOR, OF COURSE, IS CHINA. OBVIOUSLY, WE ALL KNOW THE THINGS THAT THEY 'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. SO WE EXPECT SOME UNIQUE RECOVERY IN THE CHINA MARKET AS THAT ECONOMY STARTS COMING BACK, WE BELIEVE.

      "SPEAKER_01:back to What Just Happened on Yahoo Finance. And to understand the industry -wide job cuts that we're seeing in tech, we have to go back to tech stocks' monster rally before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in this cycle. The Nasdaq 100, it surged by nearly 1 ,500 percent. If you look back to its prior big bear market low, that was all the way back in 2008, and its most recent high, which happened around November 2021. And that period, not coincidentally, was characterized by what you see on the bottom here, which is ultra -low interest rates. We did have a brief period of increases in 2017 and 2018 before rates were cut again. But large -cap tech pretty much kept climbing over that period of time. And that's because growth stocks, especially tech, flourish when rates are low. There are two main reasons. A low cost of capital and high incentives for equity investors. So let's talk about that first point. Growth companies want to, well, they want to grow. The early -stage model in particular typically involves spending a lot on things like hiring or software development or building a factory that is investing for future growth. When interest rates are low, it's less expensive for companies to borrow money to fuel those initiatives. More mature companies also tend to borrow in this environment. And here's the reasoning. Even if I have a lot of cash on hand, why should I spend my rainy day fund when I can get a cheap loan instead? Investors, meanwhile, were pouring jet fuel on tech's growth. If rates are low and I'm a retail investor, I'm not getting much return on, say, my savings account or really any fixed income investment like bonds. And maybe I'm doing the same as big companies are doing and borrowing money to invest. For example, if I get a loan and pay 3 % interest on that, since I'm pretty confident and I can make a higher return elsewhere or a much higher return elsewhere in the stock market, for example. All of this reasoning and all of this came to a halt last year as inflation proved to be quite intransitory. The Federal Reserve started raising rates and then it kept going. And that has triggered what's called tightening in financial conditions. Among other things, borrowing costs for companies have gone higher and institutional and individual money is no longer flooding into the stock market. That's all resulted in the whomp. For tech stocks in the past year, despite a rally so far in 2023, the Nasdaq 100 is still down about 28 % from that high that we were at back in November 2021. And of course, some individual tech giants were hit even harder last year. If you look at the likes of Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon, Meta in particular, I think, was down something like 68 % last year. And there's the idea that investors are paying a premium for growth stocks future. And that's not just about the future. Their reputation rests on the promise of future earnings. This has caused investors to question just how much those future cash flows that tech companies really are going to be worth in, say, five years and whether the earnings are worth waiting for. As we know, where there are doubts, there is investor pullback. Tech companies cut off from the supply of easy money, wound up cutting costs somewhere. And that somewhere has ended up in part being what we have seen in payroll, Rochelle.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:So, if investors are pulling out of tech, where is the money now headed\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Well, some of the money has gone back into tech, as we've seen so far in 2023. But traditionally, when people are looking for a potential slowdown or a recession on the horizon, they go to a few places, right? They go into fixed income. And we have been hearing that from investor after investor. Fixed income, one of the most popular trades this year. That's in part because yields are going up, right? If I'm buying government debt, then I'm getting more for my money. If I'm buying investment grade bonds, I'm getting more yield on my money. So -called value stocks, right? Those that have been beaten up but are still seeing as a value. Financials usually fall into that category. Sometimes consumer staples like Procter & Gamble fall into that category. And then there's some overlap between value stocks and defensives, right? Companies that are seen as being able to expand their profits even in an economic downturn. You've got energy stocks, although there's some crossover with value, as I said, like the likes of Exxon Mobil. And then actual defense companies sometimes as well, like a Lockheed Martin.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:then, Julie, when can we expect to see a bounce back or a recovery? I know we're starting to see a little something with Meta at this point.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Yeah, with a lot of these tech stocks, we've seen a little bit of a pullback. But a lot of the investors that we've spoken to say tech stocks can't really recover in a meaningful, sustained way until interest rates stop going up or even start to go down from the Federal Reserve. Now, that said, we've had this divergence, right, between the Federal Reserve and where rates have been going. The Federal Reserve isn't done raising rates. It's expected to raise them by another 25 billion. It's expected to raise them by another 25 billion. And that's going to be the biggest points next week. But the 10 -year Treasury yield, which tracks rates and perceptions about them, has actually gone down so far this year. That's one of the things that probably has helped the Nasdaq 100. But we don't know if that is going to remain intact, Rochelle.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Don't know when the Fed is going to take their foot off the gas or pause at this point. Either great stuff there, Julie Hyman.\n",
      "3uNS4copPiU.mp4\n",
      "\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:let's roll back and recap what's happened thus far. Dan, give us the lowdown.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:That's right, Rochelle. The tech industry is reeling from a seemingly nonstop parade of layoffs across Silicon Valley and beyond. And we're not talking small numbers either. Amazon cut 18 ,000 jobs, Alphabet laid off 12 ,000 workers, and Meta let go of 11 ,000 employees. Microsoft, meanwhile, slashed 10 ,000 positions. And those are just the major announcements. So it's important to put those layoffs in perspective. Compared to the massive number of employees they hired during the pandemic, big tech companies have cut a relatively small number of jobs. So why are we seeing these layoffs? Well, the macroeconomic situation isn't helping, but each company has problems of their own. Google is dealing with slowing ad sales, ditto Meta, though that company is also pouring billions into its risky Metaverse bet. Microsoft has contended with slowing PC and cloud sales. And Amazon just can't get enough people to buy things from its customers.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:and it's interesting because when you break it down, we hear tech layoffs, but as you think, there's a lot of nuances there within some of these companies. And given how much they did overhire during the pandemic, you have to wonder how much more we might see in terms of cuts ahead. And notably, Apple not also on that list as well, Dan.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:they're seemingly the only one that doesn't have to do any layoffs. There's been talk about how they were very, very easy on hiring during the pandemic. So they didn't go out and say, look, this is all going to change. They're going to change the world entirely. We have to staff up super quick. That's basically what Amazon did. They nearly doubled their workforce. But they went slower. They figured, look, we sell devices. We know that there's demand for devices. We're going to continue to provide those devices. But we don't need the headcount to do that. They already put out more than enough handsets. In fact, for Apple, it was almost a different problem because they were dealing with a chip shortage. So because they are a hardware sales company, they had to contend with that side of the pandemic. Not necessarily the staffing up issue. So that seems to be why they were able to kind of move through this time of layoffs relatively unscathed. Yes, there are some hiring slowdowns, but we haven't heard anything about layoffs.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:we'll be keeping an eye, although they do have hiring freezes. But as you mentioned, they're not layoffs at the moment.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:back to Yahoo Finance. Let's get over to Jared Blickery at the Wi -Fi Interactive. Jared. Looking at a little bit of down action but not much to begin the day. But it's been a positive week overall. Let's check out what the Dow has done. Now, 1 .66%, I think the bulls will take that. And check out the NASDAQ. NASDAQ really fulfilling or continuing its role as a leader this year, which is contrasting to last year. NASDAQ is up over 3 % over the last few days. And let's just take a longer -term look at the market here. Here's the S &P 500 over the last nine months. You can see we are right up against this late November, December peak that we had there. Going to have to climb over that. Already over the 200 -day moving average. So we keep having these incremental technical levels. But 4100 is really the level for me. NASDAQ also in a similar situation trying to overcome its highs from late last year. The Russell 2000, though, let me just change this to a candlestick view. You can see just barely. Barely breaking out. And on top of that, we got SOX, we got the chip stocks on ready to break out here. We also have transportation. So let's take a look at the sectors. We have communication services. That is in the lead. That's up half a percent. Industrials. Also looking at consumer discretionary. Excuse me. That's in the lead. And financials. Those have been some three winners this year. Tech taking a little bit of a backseat. I think that's on the back of those Intel earnings. Let's take a look at that board. You can see Intel down 10%. KLA down 7%. A lot of red here. But not deep red for the most part. Software kind of a mixed board. More red than green. IBM up one -third of a percent there. And let's take a look at what's happened with our sector for the week. And you can see it's all about the mega caps. Consumer discretionary, the worst sector last year along with communication services and then tech and then financials and then energy. Interesting mix of not only the value but also some cyclical sectors there. Some growth sectors. So pretty good mix going forward. Let's check out the leaders. ARK. And this is over the last five days. ARK is in the lead. That's up 5%. I talked about defense. ITA. That is a defense ETF. That's up 4%. Even with those Intel earnings in that red screen we saw with the chip stocks, those are up 4. So all in all, pretty risk -on week here. And we'll have to see if this can continue throughout the day into the close and, of course, next week as well.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:right, Shana, let's check out what's moving after hours. All right, we've got a lot to take a look at here, Dave. We have Intel, KLA, Visa, Hasbro, and Salesforce kicking off with Intel. That stock off just about 8 % here after hours. A weak report here from the company, missing on both the top and bottom lines. Their guidance coming in a bit light. We certainly are seeing that reflected in the after hours move here. The CFO of Intel saying that they did take steps to right -size the business in Q4. We know they're cost -cutting efforts. They're looking to cut $3 billion in costs this year, up to $10 billion in 2025. Over the last three months, the stock has gotten a bit of a boost here, up just about 10 .5%, nearly giving all of that back, though, in extended trading. Taking a look at KLA, that stock also under a bit of pressure, off just about 5 % right now. The company's thinking as they outlook disappointed. This, of course, follows that drop in the chip demand. So Intel, KLA, those reports disappointing. We're seeing that also reflected in some of those competitors out there. Their NVIDIA stock under pressure. Qualcomm stock under pressure here after hours. So a couple of names to keep in mind ahead of tomorrow's opening bell. Taking a look at Hasbro, that stock off just about 9 % of a huge headlines here. They announced their preliminary results, cutting 1 ,000 jobs, 15 % of their workforce. President and COO here, Eric Nyman, will also be leaving the company. The prelim Q4 revenue number missed. EPS coming in a bit light. Holiday sales, quote, underperformed. Certainly, we're seeing that reflected in that. 9 % drop. Taking a look at Visa, that stock up just about 1 .5 % here. The company beating on both the top and bottom lines. Payment volume up 7%. Visa also saying that effective February 1st, Brian McInerney will be taking over as CEO. Again, we're looking at gains here after hours. Rounding it out with Salesforce. That stock under a bit of pressure after popping here in intraday trading, but off just about a half of a percent. A Wall Street Journal report now out saying that Elliott is preparing to nominate directly for the position of CEO. And and we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about how Elliott is preparing to nominate directors at Salesforce. They didn't name any specific names, but clearly a battle is heating up for some of those board seats. Now, the Journal reports followed the Bloomberg report that we got out earlier this afternoon, saying that Salesforce is discussing appointing a new board member. Some of those names that were being discussed, former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, MasterCard CFO Sachin Meran. Now, this is for Salesforce. Wall Street Journal now reporting that Elliott is preparing to nominate its own directors here for Salesforce. Again, the stock up. barely in positive territory over the last few months, up just about 3%.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:off with Tesla. Tesla closing up just about 11%. One of the leader in the Nasdaq 100 today, closing at its highest level that we've seen in the last six months. That's a fourth quarter results came in better than fear. Now Wall Street reacting positively to the numbers and the comments about strong demand from CEO Elon Musk. We have Citigroup, Bank of America, Wolf Research, Wells Fargo, Callan, Webush. Among the names they're raising their price target. And Dave, taking a look at the momentum that we're clearly seeing in Tesla stock. We talked to Gary Black earlier in the show. He's a future fund managing partner there. Clearly a Tesla bull. He was saying that the Cybertruck is going to be one of the huge catalysts. Get people back on the hype train when it comes to Tesla and really take it back to those higher levels that we had seen. Let me take out some of the losses that we've seen over the last 12 months. I'm not sold yet, but clearly the street very encouraged by what we did get from Tesla and by the commentary. Thank you. That we heard from Musk. Are\n",

I love trucks and I love Teslas, but that car will not be driven by most Americans. It frankly will not. And people always use the pre -orders as the real catalyst. Those pre -orders are fully refundable. $100 fully refundable deposit. I'm not buying it. But he also pointed out they're not just a car company, Gary Black. It's a real car company. I'm pointing out that mega packs, for example, could be a real catalyst for tremendous earnings down the road. But he said something really interesting as well about Elon Musk's macro talk about the economy. He said investors really don't pay attention to it. But the problem is Elon Musk on that call really undermined his own argument on that call by saying we're going to go through a pretty difficult recession and then saying he sees skyrocketing demand for real estate.

And like we've talked about time and time again, it's a fix that's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time. So Southwest currently has their work cut out for them.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:I was just curious why you thought JetBlue was down slightly on a really good report. Is that because the good news is already baked in? They've already had a pretty solid month?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:they've had a pretty solid month. And when you take a look at some of those larger charts, you have seen longer term charts, I should say. You have seen a bit of a rebound more recently. The stock barely closing negative there. But like you were saying, it was a very different quarter than what we just heard from Southwest. They said that they were on track to deliver those cost reductions that they had been targeting of $250 million through 2024. The CEO saying that the demand environment remains solid this year. So clearly, totally different picture over at JetBlue. Let's take a look at MasterCard because shares of the credit card company closing lower here. You can see off just over 1 % after the company warned that revenue could be down. So that's a big difference. So let's take a look at MasterCard. The growth could slow faster than expected in the current quarter. Still, though, MasterCard's CEO saying in a statement that, quote, while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient. He then went on to say, we are well prepared to adjust our investment profile quickly if needed. So it's interesting just to weigh that against the reaction that we're seeing in the stock price today. And taking a look at the analyst reaction here, they actually said that trends in January, look, quote, unquote, healthy so far. So a drop of 1%, not too much to be worried about.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:No, and it's so interesting. Again and again and again, we hear these predictions of recession and more from the earnings call from their CEO pointed out strong labor market, low unemployment, rising wages, elevated consumer savings levels. And it's a lot like we heard from Paul Reilly, Raymond James, CEO, early in the show saying, I just don't see it. We don't see it in our clients. We don't see it in our customers, but we're going to prepare for it. So it's a strange dichotomy going on with this economy where everyone's coming out and saying we don't see a recession in our customers and our clients, but we're going to potentially prepare. Hopefully we don't see it. Yeah, hopefully we do not.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:right, we're just a few minutes away from the closing bell, so let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery to break down today's market action. Hello, sir. Hello. Let's start out with the energy sector. By the way, energy sector, the leading sector today, up 3%, followed by all the mega cap sectors, XLY, XLC, XLK. We'll get to some of those in a minute. Let's check this out, because tomorrow morning we're getting Chevron earnings. Today we are getting an announcement that they are increasing their buyback to $75 billion. This is on top of their existing authorization. They're also hiking their dividend. No expiration date on the buybacks, but RBC expects the oil major to ratchet up the monthly pace. JP Morgan also believing that this could signal better guidance in Chevron's announcement. Tomorrow morning we're going to bring you to that live. And let's just take a look. What's happened in the energy sector this year? We know is one of the best. Well, it was by far the best sector last year, but we can see Schlumberger up 7%, Exxon up 6%. We're going to be getting into a lot of those energy earnings in the coming days. Also want to check out something called Sherwin -Williams here. And if I can find my home builders screen, we're going to see that that is down substantially. Sherwin down about 8 .5%. And, well, I'll tell you what, the only thing worse than watching paint dry is watching your portfolio shrink. Because that's what we're talking about. Because, guess what, having its worst day in two quarters, and that's after delivering a full year forecast that disappointed. Now, we know the housing sector has been battered and bruised, and Sherwin, as a proxy, is now issuing a warning. Here's the CEO saying, we will not be immune from what we expect to see to be a very challenging demand environment in 2023. Visibility, that's beyond our first half of the year. That's going to be limited. So, caveat painter here. And let's get back to some of the meme stocks that we've been talking about. Most recently, Bed Bath & Beyond. Let's get to the intraday. We got that right there. Bed Bath & Beyond has so shrunk that it's hard to find on this screen here. Let me just sort by equal weight here. And we can see at the very bottom, there we go. There have been several price halts today due to volatility. And that's based on the explanation that they gave in their 10Q or 8K today, saying that they may have to file for reorganization. That means Chapter 11. So, it looks like we got about a minute left here. Let's just cycle through some of the happenings today. We checked out the sector action before. Let's check out our market leaders. Now, K -Web, that is a Chinese ETF. That is in the forefront. That's up almost 3%. But then we have IGV. That is a software tech ETF. FDN is internet ETF. So, those leading is actually pretty strong. Ahead of ARK, even stronger. We're also seeing some strength in the chip stocks. All of these on the top line are outperforming cannabis stocks and this liquidity, this U .S. bond ETF. Those are the only ones in the red. Now, as promised, here is the NASDAQ 100 where we see the mega caps cooperating. We see Microsoft up 3 % after its earnings the other day. Tesla up 10%. We're going to be bringing you Intel after the bell. So, stay tuned for that in just a few minutes. Other than that, Meta, even Meta is up 4%. Didn't see really any news about that today, but it's nice to see all this green.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:Intel and you can see probably not a good report. Down five and a half percent after hours on their latest earnings. Let's bring in Jared Blickrey who has the earnings numbers for us. Presumably not good ones.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:it was a miss on both the top and bottom lines and the guidance even worse. Let's talk about the fourth quarter right now. That's a 14 .04 billion for adjusted revenue when the estimate was for higher at 14 .5 billion. Now that breaks down into client computing, network and mobile eye revenue, also Intel foundry services, but mainly client computing revenue. That was a big miss. 6 .63 billion. Estimate was for 7 .42 billion. Network and edge revenue 2 .06 billion. The estimate was for 2 .2 billion. And then mobile eye, that's spinning off, but that came in at 565, besting the streets estimate of 435 million. Now adjusted EPS I said was also a miss. That was 10 cents versus the estimate of 19 cents. Operating margin disappointing 4 .3 % versus the estimate of 7 .22%. And then finally for the fourth quarter numbers, I'm going to round this out with adjusted gross margin. 43 .8 % a miss below the estimate of 45%. Now here's where we get into that forecast. They're seeing first quarter numbers. First quarter adjusted gross margin 39%. The estimate was 45 .5. Intel sees first quarter adjusted loss per share of 15 cents. Guess what? The estimate was for a profit of 25 cents. So that going in the wrong direction. It's also seeing adjusted revenue 10 .5 billion to 11 .5 billion dollars when the estimate was for 13, almost 14 billion dollars. So they're looking to make 8 to 10 billion dollars in cost reductions by the end of 2025. And you know, Pat Gelsinger is a turnaround strategy, probably under a bit of scrutiny here. There's going to be some tough answers for him to field on the call. Should he be there? Which I would expect him to. As you can see, some of the other chip makers down in sympathy, Nvidia down 1%, AMD down 2%. And let me just get to a quick chart of Intel here over the last few years so we can see what's happened over the pandemic. Basically from the upper left to the lower right here. And that is not the best way for a chart to be situated down 56 % over that time period. Guys.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:get you up to speed on Salesforce shares moving to the upside this afternoon. Now up just over 4%. The move here coming following a report from Bloomberg that the enterprise software company is discussing appointing new board members. The names being discussed include former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, also MasterCard CFO Sachin Mehra. Now the report also states that there are discussions about adding Value Act Capital Management CEO Mason Morfitt to the board as well. Salesforce has become a target for activist investors. Most recently this week, Elliott Management, which took a multi -billion dollar stake in the company. And Dave, like you and I have been talking about this week, when Elliott Management enters the picture, people listen.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Patrick Gadsden, who's an activist investor attorney, joined us just a couple of days ago, said they are basically the Godzilla of the space. They get what they want, they take as much time as they want, and they spend as much money as they want to get their results. But he also said, That news that Elliott Management was involved here probably was because either talks had broken down or there was some sort of agreement to satisfy Paul Singer slash Elliott Management. And it looks like, Shonda, that he was probably fortuitous in that, that they had some sort of board agreement in place and Elliott wanted to get credit for that. That's just me reading into that. They wanted credit for that, therefore leaking the story.\n",

So good news, yes, mortgage rates continue to fall. Some predict that the worst is behind us in terms of the housing market. I think that is fantastic. I do think mortgage rates, Shauna, are beginning to flatten out, though, because the reductions are shrinking. I thought we might land in the mid -fives. I don't think so anymore.

The majority of the buyers that have been on the sidelines for the last couple of months to get them off the sidelines. And remember, the Fed is still raising rates. We've got another Fed meeting next week. Investors are expecting another 25 basis point hike. So as long as that continues or they keep rates at those elevated levels, you've got to question whether or not we really will see significant improvement in housing.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:And we should remind you, rates don't necessarily rise and fall with Fed moves, but they do tend to similarly shadow that later. And the bottom line is here, most people are locked into a mortgage somewhere between two and a half, maybe low three. So you're still looking at twice your mortgage rate to get you off of the sideline. Probably not enough.\n",

Brooke DePalma is here with the details. Obviously, they're hiring. Meanwhile, it's interesting. You're seeing a lot of tech still going through their layoffs and firings here.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:right. Good morning, Rochelle. Chipotle investing heavily in labor this morning out with that announcement of hiring 15 ,000 workers ahead of its busy season, or what it calls its burrito season, from the months of March to May. Now, it's important to confirm here that those new hires will be kept on beyond just the busy season. They're calling this what it calls a hiring campaign called Pull Back the Foil. It features employees who have rose in the ranks from crew members to managers. Now, in 2022, 90 % of crew members, or rather managerial roles, were internal promotion. This comes as Chipotle has aggressive growth plans. It plans to open 7 ,000 locations in North America. In 2023 alone, it plans to open 255 to 285 new restaurants.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Brooke, this comes as voters in California are set to decide on a new law that could come with some changes.\n",

As it was supposed to go into effect on January 1st, but a petition gathered enough signatures for it to be put on pause, I guess you could say, and put on that ballot. Now, of course, this would form a 10 -person committee that would ultimately be able to weigh in on minimum wage. And I think that's what we're going to see. And more things that have to do with labor and wage for fast food workers, but some opposition here. Of course, CEOs not liking this, but unionization efforts and union groups certainly advocates for this as they're always looking to improve labor and wage conditions here.C -Suite's talking against it. The latest announcement comes from McDonald's, who spoke out on the FAST Recovery Act, saying that, in part, an unelected council of political insiders, not local business owners, and their teams will make big decisions about crucial elements of running a business, fracturing the economy in the process. And this has been an ongoing concern last year. Chipotle CEO weighing in on this and the impact that it could have on a higher wage.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:right, Rochelle. We're seeing more and more job cuts from the tech industry. Obviously, it's already been stung by huge, huge pullbacks in jobs from the likes of Amazon, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and now we're seeing them from IBM, though not as large as we saw from either Microsoft, Meta, or Amazon, which was in the tens of thousands. This is much lower. We're also seeing them from SAP. And really, the big overarching kind of message is that, yeah, we hired too many people during the pandemic. We thought that this was going to be a new way of life. And so we ended up hiring for that. Obviously, that's not the case. We're not the case. People don't want to just be on computers forever. They want to be able to go outside or they just don't necessarily need to be on them so much. So now we're seeing these companies try to kind of course correct after making those enormous hires. That's not to say, though, especially in the case of IBM, that they're not going to be hiring anymore. A number of these companies, you know, there are hiring freezes at some, but a number of them will continue to hire in very specific areas, those being related to things like, the cloud or, you know, heavy computing areas. So it's not as though there's a complete stoppage when it comes to hiring in these areas. It's just that they're trying to now cut back on what they did hire. And, you know, we had a chart a few days ago basically showing the percentage of workforces for different tech companies that were hired during the pandemic versus who were being let go now.it seems as though they're not letting go as many as they hired. So, obviously, you know, we can see here Amazon with that 18 ,000, Alphabet with 12 ,000, Meta with 11, Microsoft with 10, and then, you know, down and down from there. But, you know, it seems as though this is something that is just going to basically roil the tech industry perhaps for the next few months.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:as you're talking about there, a lot of overhiring, but some of these big layoffs, are we at the end of perhaps some of these major layoffs? Do we expect more to continue as we still have to different tech companies and sort of rehiring them? I\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I think, you know, this is basically what we're going to have from the companies that have announced so far. You know, obviously, we have Intel announcing their earnings after the bell. There was some rumbling about them potentially having layoffs as a result of the drop in PC demand. You know, that's really suffered. People purchased their computers during the pandemic. They don't need to buy them again for perhaps another five years. So, that's really hurting them a good deal. I think we could hear something from the chip space. That's, you know, we haven't really heard much from there. We've heard that there are hiring freezes or there are slowdowns, but nothing as far as layoffs. I think that might be the next place we start to see it.\n",

Though just because he's reinstated, it doesn't mean he will return. For more on Meta's decision and its impact to the social media landscape, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Ali Garfinkel. We know he was also invited back to Twitter. Didn't seem to be interested in that. So where do things stand here then with Meta?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Rochelle, I'll be completely honest with you here. I'm sort of struggling to take the temperature on this moment because on one hand, it feels almost a little anticlimactic. It's been a few years and he sort of has been invited back, as it were. But on the other hand, it feels high stakes and the takes are flying. And I think it's important to run through those takes just a little bit, because from the legal side, what we have is this renewed conversation about the definition of town square. Now, some legal experts are telling me that in terms of Trump's constitutional rights to free speech. This could be the right thing to do. This is the right call on Meta's part, if you believe Meta is running a digital town square. However, to others, since Meta is a private company, this isn't a public town square they're running. It's a private business. So you already have that legal side of it. And going beyond that, it's as thorny as you'd expect. I have advocates telling me that they're worried this will increase Trump's reach through 2024 as the election grows closer. And even one professor I was speaking to was saying that we need to remember that this could give Trump a powerful fundraising tool. However. It's important to say Meta was very equivocal in this. They're not giving him free rein here. They've said that they will be monitoring him closely and that there will be what they call guardrails. And I will say those guardrails are very necessary. We have to remember the reason he was banned in the first place. And that was the events of January 6th.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:then, I mean, what happens next here? Because he may or may not decide to hop on these, but it's hard to imagine he doesn't get back on these platforms when you think about his presidential aspirations.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:know. I think it's really unclear, Rachelle, right? But on one hand, it would make sense. But on the other, he has Truth Social. And we now know just because he's reinstated, though, doesn't mean he will leave Truth Social. It doesn't mean he'll return to these platforms. For instance, as you said earlier, Elon Musk reinstated him to Twitter a while back, and he has opted to stay off the platform so far. So I think where this could get interesting is it could be a huge story over time. We could see things go back. We could see renewed efforts at content moderation. One expert I was speaking to said that this was as scary as this was for him personally. This was also an opportunity to reimagine how content moderation can work for someone with the profile of Donald Trump. In the end, though this could be a major story, there could also be radio silence.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:true. I don't know. Trump and silence don't usually go hand in hand, especially with how much might be at stake in 2024. But stranger things have happened. We'll keep an eye on that.not a strength, but we'll see. We'll see. Nellie Goldfinkle there. Thank you so much for that update.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:boon for bonds. Fixed income set to see an additional boost as the Fed is expected to raise interest rates and is unlikely to change its course until inflation data improves. But not all fixed income is made equal. Here with more is Chip Hewey, Truist Wealth Managing Director of Fixed Income. Good to see you, Hewey. So as we've been mentioning there in the intro there, lots of different strategies you have obviously active, passive, a hybrid for people who are trying to figure out which strategy or how they should use these strategies in this environment. How should they navigate this?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:great. Thanks, Rochelle. It's great to be with you. Thanks for the opportunity. I think that there's really two main ways where we see an attractive opportunity in fixed income, two ways to approach it. So on the one hand, we have sort of the passive approach. In the front end of the yield curve, in the first two, three years of the curve, we're seeing some of the highest yields that we've seen in the past 15 years. And that's largely a result of the... Of the Fed's interest rate increases. And so buying individual high quality securities there, you're capturing some of the highest yields we've seen in more than a decade, but it also gives the opportunity to allow those bonds to roll to maturity and to make routine reinvestment decisions at that point, given the economic uncertainty we've seen, that's a pretty valuable amount of optionality, flexibility in making new decisions as we get new data.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:then what are some of the ones that you're rolling out or rolling into to really account for some of the changes expected ahead?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:So that speaks sort of to the other way to approach it, more of a portfolio or total return context. Back in late October, we upgraded our views of durations, so longer dated fixed income, because we do see risks of recession rising as we progress through this year. And if you go back through history, long duration or longer dated high quality fixed income does tend to outperform. The economy slows down or enters recession. So from a portfolio context, we saw greater value in duration as the 10 year rose above, call it 4%, 4 and a quarter. And that's still what we see. We recommend a few things. One, keeping fixed income simple for right now, staying high quality in anticipation of opportunities in riskier fixed income down the road over the course of the next six to 12 months. That would probably be a better opportunity for an entry point. At that point. Right now, though, when we made that upgrade to duration, the 10 year was a fair amount higher, about 425. So we would be a little bit more patient for major duration moves right now. We are right in the middle of the trading range that we identified coming into this year. But if we see yields rise up towards that 4 % range again, value comes back again for duration.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:this can be hard because obviously a lot of people, when we see the markets move with every single Fed announcement, we know that the Fed is going to continue on this road. At least we're expecting that 25 basis point hike, but still don't seem to be at that threshold where they plan on pausing anytime soon. How are you factoring in when then to extend or reduce duration on some of these?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:so we do expect the Fed to raise by 25 basis points next week, possibly one to two more 25 basis point rate hikes beyond that. And then we expect the Fed to move to a pause. We expect the Fed to move to a pause and to hold rate steady. And I think that one thing that perhaps the market is under appreciating, we think that it's a really high bar for the Fed to start reducing those rates. They have a tremendous amount of scar tissue from the inflation experience that we've just gone through over the course of the past 12 to 18 months. And we're going to need to see inflation data consistently cool and stay on this downward trajectory before the Fed gains comfort in potentially cutting. And right now, the market is probably going to be a little bit more calm. We're going to be pricing in multiple cuts by the end of this year. We're not completely convinced that the Fed won't hold steady and allow inflation to cool and also to relieve some of the tightness that we're seeing in the labor market.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:between some of the extra optimism, as you were saying, in some of these estimates as to whether the Fed will start, when the Fed will start cutting this year, you also have, of course, issues over the debt ceiling. Now, obviously, we're expecting this to be resolved. But what should people keep in mind as we have this period of volatility right now?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:I'll stay right out in the outset because we've been getting a lot of questions about this. And it's a really important question. We do think that ultimately Congress comes to an agreement and the U .S. averts default. But if we go back to the most similar proxy to what we're to what we're seeing now, we have to go back to to 2011 when it was another contentious debt ceiling debate. And what we did see is as that deadline approached, investors grew very uneasy. Actually, over the course of about a month, the 10 year fell about 100, 100 basis points or one percent in yields as investors flew into into quality, right, into a risk off mentality. And we saw rate volatility really spike around that deadline. So we do think that it is it is likely that we will see volatility increase as we move as we move towards that deadline. The likelihood of some of some kind of brinksmanship tactics. And in some 11th hour negotiations could make the market feel pretty uneasy. And so it is that is a deadline to watch. But we do think that the worst outcomes that a lot of attention is on right now are ultimately going to be going to be avoided.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:good to keep that in mind, because when when things start going a bit left towards that, people should keep that keep that steady hand. But ultimately, Congress does always end up resolving this. Chip Huey, their truest wealth managing director, fixed income. Thank you so much. Thanks.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:is a concern, it has been for a long time. And I think we've published research many times in the past where we say the thing is, one, the enemy is inside of Tesla. You know, Musk is an incredible driving force, but he's also the one that brings unnecessary risk in a way to the situation. At the same time, what we have to keep in mind is, what we say as well, is Tesla is bigger than Musk. So he has been the impetus. The question with Elon Musk as an individual, he does a lot of things, maybe too many things. But it's not like he's going to listen to, if you tell him what to do, he's not going to do it. He has to self -correct. So he is the person who is going to decide, can I do SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter? Do I have to... Can he though, for a little bit? Do you think he can? Exactly. No. Well, that again is, you're not going to tell him and I'm not going to tell him because you won't listen. It's up to him. He's going to have to make that decision. And what we need to be comfortable with as investors, let's say, Tom Zhu has been rumoured as being a number two coming in. Great news that he's got the values of Tesla. So that's an internal point that's very important. But will he be given a free rein to run Tesla if that's what is decided? And that's the part that is going to take time for us to get comfortable with that. Again, no, the self -correcting mechanism at Elon Musk is Elon Musk and nobody else.\n",

      "SPEAKER_01:well, we're looking to the skies now. Several major airlines report their quarterly performance with Southwest experiencing the most turbulence after its holiday travel debacle serves as a pain point for the U .S. airline. We're here to discuss is Mike Boyd, president of Boyd Group International. I mean, we were looking at an $800 million pre -tax hit, which really affected earnings. They had an earnings miss because of that. Still, though, a revenue beat. How would you characterize where Southwest is, though, because all that focus really on that loss?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:is the most difficult time they've ever had. People have always relied on Southwest for three things. Low fares, lack of fees and enormous public support. The low fares aren't there anymore. They price reasonably. Other airlines have done away with fees, a lot of fees. And now after what happened over the Christmas, you had millions of people who were really badly, badly hurt. So they can't rely now on the fact that everyone loves it. They've got to pick up from bootstraps and try to rebuild their airline as a going concern for the consumer.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Southwest really does have some of the most loyal fans. I think you compared them to to Grateful Dead groupies, but obviously a bad experience can change a lot of that. And we did see President and CEO Bob Jordan recognizing how much they'd let their customers down. And they talked about these cancellations, though, and slower bookings continuing in January and February. They even said in their SEC filing, based on current revenue and cost, they're going to be looking at a new year. So it's a great opportunity to see if we can get back to the So we've got the first quarter of 2023. Net loss trends. We currently expect a first quarter 2023 net loss. However, we are encouraged by the current booking trends of March of 2023. Our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year over year margin expansion for the full year 2023. Would you be as optimistic? Do you think those ripple effects are going to have perhaps gone away by then?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:Trump runs into an unexpected Ready to Reign niez and COVIDrevenue? support they've had before December.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:certainly seeing the stock price punished for that. I mean, he did apologize again in that SEC filing. And he also said that they do plan to investigate what happened and really invest in technology as well. What is it going to take then for Southwest to really regain the competitive edge, being that now it is perhaps at a more level playing field with some of these bigger airlines?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:right now, I mean, the warning is there. They've got to fix the one system that caused all this. It's one system, one airline that caused this disaster. It is being addressed. But again, you have people out there that are saying that I didn't see grandma for the last time. I didn't have a good Hanukkah. I did not have a good Christmas. And it's all Southwest's fault. And when I asked for a refund, they only gave my ticket back. Southwest has a lot of work to do to get that back again, because they're in a hole right now.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:you have American Airlines really touting how well they've been operationally. Over the holiday season, strong demand picture, earnings beat record Q4 and full year as well. How does how does American Airlines compare? Because we also saw JetBlue with record revenue as well. But it does seem to be a tale of margins.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:one thing to look, flexibility is going to be everything in the next three years. Flexibility meaning what you can fly, how you can fly, where you can fly. Southwest Airlines has two different configurations, 137 seats, 175. And then above that and below that, they really can't access. So there's going to be someone in a corner fleet wise, and that's going to be a challenge as well, becausethe next five years, what you can do is look at how many markets you can operate and have multimission airplanes, this is what people haven't noticed, but Southwest Airlines may have a deficit there.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:about JetBlue? Because, I mean, they saw Q4 record revenue as well, but they definitely weren't as optimistic about what their first quarter of 2023 was going to look like.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:they, they need to be optimistic. But guess what, they need to be optimistic and raise their status on Q4. their purchase of Spirit was not a merger. They bought assets. They're the one airline today, if that purchase goes through, they're going to have airplanes, new airplanes, and they're going to have pilots. Other airlines are going to look for others because they bought the assets really of Spirit, and they're going to be the best postured airline over the next three to four years to grow. And I'm looking forward to seeing how well they grow because it's going to be huge.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:do you see the perhaps market share changing as we look at this industry? I mean, look at some of the changes and investments these major airlines are making.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:you know, the big issue we have to realize is a new world. I mean, you know, four years ago, you had 8 million people back and forth between China and the U .S. That's down to 100 ,000 or 200 ,000. Now it's going to stay there. So you have to be able to move very flexibly. And if you move flexibly, that means you have to have a fleet to do that. So I would say you're looking at airlines like American Delta, United. These are all very well -managed airlines. And same thing with Alaska. So I'm looking at airlines like American Delta, United. These are all very well -managed airlines. I'm thinking the shares are going to stay the same because airlines now are only going to fly what they want to fly. They're not chasing economics anymore. They're making the economics.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:right, well, Tesla out with a beat on the top and bottom line in its latest quarter, with the stock seeing a pop this morning on the back of its earnings release as the EV maker eased investor fears of weaker growth. However, the view on Tesla among analysts shows not all is smooth sailing. Here with the details is Yahoo Finance's Praz Subramanian. Obviously, a lot of people were watching this to see what would happen.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Rochelle, you know, big earnings and big call last night. Analysts' reaction mixed, you know, a nice pop today in the stock. You have people like Dan Ives calling it the Super Bowl for Tesla. But you're absolutely right, though, you know, among others, there's been some sort of kind of consternation about what this means. So, you know, Goldman's Mark Delaney reiterated his buy rating here, claiming Musk's comments on January orders being to date the strongest ever was, quote, the most important takeaway from the call. And I tend to agree with that. On the flip side, Tony Sakunagi, Alliance Bernstein, a noted Tesla bear, reiterated his underperformed rating. They're saying he's torn after the call. And the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the earnings statement. It's concerned about margins and whether demand can be sustained at these levels. Finally, Citi's Itay Mikali, he raised his price like it's 146, claiming the call gave him some, gave some relief to the bulls. But there are still concerns like margins and a big free cash flow miss last night, which is actually kind of flew under the radar. So kind of a mixed bag here from the analyst point of view, but the stock, I mean, there's no, there's no discussion. The stock's up 10 % today.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:we knew that margins were going to be a big theme this earnings season, but you mentioned things flying under the radar. What are some of the things that one might've missed from Tesla's earnings?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:know, there was a lot on that call from Cybertruck to, to FSD and things like that. But I think under the radar, some stuff, Musk talking about how he started wants to maintain strong volume growth while maintaining margins. You know, that's kind of tough in an environment right here where, where margins are under pressure, prices, inflation has been rising, but maybe if prices do come down and you have ramp ups in places like Berlin and Giga Austin, maybe you can have that both at that, that magic, that magic sort of mix of, of rising margins, but lowering prices. Another nugget that he kind of mentioned that sort of flew in the radar was, you know, talking about who could challenge Tesla down the line. Musk said it could likely be a Chinese competitor because they quote, work harder and work smarter than anyone else. Thought that was interesting, you know, kind of a diss here to American and European automakers who are sort of, you know, kind of coming at Tesla on, on domestically here, but also in Europe too.\n",

Taking a look at some of those numbers here is actually a pretty strong quarter for Tesla. Some of the commentary from Tesla just about where they see deliveries going, their long term delivery growth target. They're reaffirming the fact that they will be able to meet that 50 % target. That was of course a huge headline coming out of that report. Also remaining on track to start production of its Cybertruck later this year. Some other headlines crossing right now that Tesla did enter into a credit pact on January 20th with Citibank. The pact provides for revolving credit line of up to 5 billion commitments for up to an added $2 billion going forward. Lenders also include Deutsche Bank there. So again, Elon Musk's Tesla there slightly beating on revenue estimates here and you're seeing that stock pop after hours, Dave.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:income and revenue up 59 % and 37 % respectively from a year prior. Imagine what this company would do without the Twitter overhang, without thinking about the personality of the CEO and founder before buying a car. Boy, it'd be a lot like SpaceX, a true rocket ship. It\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:would be. All right, let's take a look at IBM. That company also reporting after the bell. You're looking at the stock under pressure off just about 2%. They did beat on the top and bottom lines. 16 .69 billion EPS, $3 .60. Another big headline coming out of this report, the fact that the company is cutting 3 ,900 jobs. So Dave, just the latest tech company there to announce job cuts.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Yeah, Daniel Newman joined us earlier and the big question has been for years, this total overhaul turnaround of IBM. It has been like turning around a giant gas tanker and it's cost them $120 billion estimated dollars. But Daniel Newman told us he thinks that transition is for the best. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and then the question is, what are the chances of the company finally completing the job? You're seeing the upside. All\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:let's take a look at ServiceNow. That stock on the move after I was here. You can see it off just about 4 .5 % and was off just about 9 % a few minutes ago. Adjusted EPS for the quarter, fourth quarter coming in $2 .28. The estimate was for $2 .02. The company seeing first quarter subscription revenue of $1 .99 billion to $2 billion. The estimate there was for $1 .96 billion. Adjusted revenue, $2 .03 billion for the company. Estimate there, $1 .99 billion. Let's take a look at Levi's. Another stock here moving after hours. It's up just about 7%. EPS beat during the quarter. Net revenue of $1 .59 billion. Estimate was for $1 .57 billion. Full year net revenue guidance also coming in pretty strong. You're seeing that stock pop after hours again. The retail sector, which many analysts have been bracing for a severe slowdown there as consumers do pull back their spending. That stock, though, beating the estimates and we're seeing that stock pop after hours. The company shares up just about 7%. Real quick, Las Vegas stands out with its results. Taking a look at shares up just about 3%. Revenue of $1 .12 billion. That was a miss. A wider than expected loss. Adjusted loss of $0 .19. The estimate there was for a loss of $0 .085. The CEO in this earnings release remaining very optimistic, saying he is still confident in the robust recovery.

      "SPEAKER_01:of some recovery in the housing market. Weekly mortgage applications increasing 7 % last week according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This coincides with three straight weeks decline of mortgage rates. Falling rates could mean Americans who held off on buying may move back into this market. 83 % of Americans say buying a home is a priority for them according to a Nerd Wallet survey. However the survey also found only 11 % plan on buying in the next 12 months so clearly we need to see some more signs of recovery. Redfin earlier today, Shana, tweeting out that they are seeing what they believe is the beginning of a turnaround. Some think the worst is still to come but one of their agents in fact said more buyers this month than all of Q4. So certainly appears to be in many parts of the country the biggest problem. The beginning of some relief.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:certainly and this is something that the housing market has been waiting for something the housing market wants to see clearly even mortgage rates to fall even further despite some of that optimistic tone that we're hearing from Redfin. Needham did cut its housing market forecast for the year today. They lower their revenue estimate for Redfin also for some of its peers Zillow and Compass. Needham saying that they're taking a more conservative approach to Redfin's future and future market gains especially not even this year but also next year looking out to 2024. So I think some questions just in terms of what the housing market what that demand is going to look like and we saw that reflected in some of those stocks today. Redfin closing off just over 8 % today so when you take a look at the pressure clearly that that is placing on the stock recently we have seen some improvement in the housing market you talk about that activity but certainly we do have a ways to go.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:surprising that two -thirds of Americans say a housing market crash is imminent. Yeah. In the next three years which is a really strange disconnect because not many who cover this sector are predicting that. There was a lot of talk about Armageddon several months ago but I think most believe that we're going to be okay. Although I do not entirely disagree with the projections from Goldman Sachs in a note earlier this week they have four markets that they believe are due for a crash which means 25 % decline or more in 2023. So we're going to have a lot of more of those cities are San Jose and look what's happening in the tech environment all those layoffs that makes sense. Austin Texas where you saw prices just go dramatically through the roof over the last year. Phoenix and San Diego and I think you could probably add about two or three others to that list. Perhaps Tampa Bay Florida I think Miami's going to be okay but both of those markets up on a 30 % increase. So there are going to be some select cities that see that 20 % fall. Yeah. So we're going to have a lot of housing prices but the most part I think low single digits.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:that wraps up today's trading day. We're gonna take a look at the numbers across the board. We didn't travel too far from the flat line. The Dow barely eking out gains, flipping back into positive territory in the final couple of minutes of trading, up just about nine points. So the S &P off by a fraction there, just below the flat line. The NASDAQ off just about two tenths of a percent. Let's get into some of the day's top movers. We gotta start with Shopify. It was a major winner today. The company announcing price increases to three of its plans, and you can see the stock closing up nearly 11%. Now, merchants will now be charged $39 for the basic plan. That's up from $29, $105 for the Shopify plan. An increase from 79 bucks. And the advanced plan has the largest increase, moving from $299 up to $399. Indeed, this is a welcome move by the street. Some analysts saying that this was long overdue. True is saying that price increases were due now for quite some time. So that increased by about 30%, 33 % across the board for its plans. Clearly, it looks like the street is pretty bullish on that, given what that could potentially do to its revenue.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Long overdue, yes. 12 years. 12 years, since they've increased their prices. But also, to your point there, these are massive price increases. Essentially, a third across the board, leaving you with that question of how many people are going to ditch Spotify because of that drastic a price increase in this economy, with inflation what it is, with the potential recession around the corner.I think a lot of people may have to get rid of Shopify, but that's not what the analysts think, because Baird says, we don't think these prices warrant a change for the vast majority of merchants, given a couple of things. The time and effort required to shift platforms, and probably most importantly, that Shopify offers superior e -commerce functionality at a reasonable price. Key bank analyst also agrees that people will not have to leave Shopify again. In this economy, I'd be surprised, though you can lock in the annual prices. If you sign on an annual deal, you can lock in the current prices right now.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:for a couple of months. I think it's also key to look at what some of its competitors have done, or when you take a look at some of the other names in that space, Intuit, Wix .com, they implemented price increases here already. So the fact that I guess Shopify now just catching up to them, maybe that's why some of these analysts aren't too worried about those churn numbers that you were just talking about. Baird actually saying that this could add $200 million to subscription revenue for 2023, and they actually see that number rising to 300 million to 350 million, an incremental revenue on an annualized basis going forward. So that I think is why we are seeing such a jump in the stock today. It's been a\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:been a good start to the year for them as well, up 30%, but that stock lost almost half its market cap in 2022, so a long way until they recover. Next up is Boeing shares teetering near the flatline. Slight gain today after the aircraft producer's fourth quarter earnings release. The company's $19 .98 billion fell short of $1 .2 billion. to the Wall Street revenue estimates, while its adjusted loss per share came in at $1 .75, more than a buck more than the street had been expecting. Boeing attributed the lagging losses to supply chain issues, while despite rebounding sales and deliveries, again, they point to really some struggle in the supply chain, but labor issues as well, Shawna.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:jet engines, other components have certainly been a challenge here for Boeing, but when you take a look at the stock reaction, initially, it caught me by a bit of surprise. A lot of that, though, has to do with the cash flow numbers that we did get from the company. They were pretty strong. When you take a lookthe cash flow beating expectations, their CEO, Dave Calhoun, though, once again reiterating the fact that those challenges, the same challenges that we have been talking about, some of those supply chain issues, do remain going forward. Revenue was about in line with expectations. It's also going to be interesting to see what the demand is like from China. We talk about the reopening there. How quickly that could potentially come back online when we talk about their economy going forward. Once that gradually starts to reopen, or the reopening, I should say, picks up more steam, that could be a bullish sign for Boeing going forward.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:said they've got more big orders in line right now than he's ever seen, and he said most of them are coming from outside the United States. FactSet surveyed 26 analysts. 18 have an overweight or a buy, seven holds, and just one sell. Gives you a pretty good sampling of how investors feel about Boeing.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:does. RBC coming out saying not a lot of news in this, but not a lot of news in this case was good news for the stock. Again, the stock closing up just about three -tenths of a percent. All right, let's take a look at AT &T, another important mover to keep on your radar. That stock closing up about 6 .5 % today. The pop coming after the company released its latest earnings report before the bell. The company produced earnings per share of 61 cents, coming in higher than the street's estimate of 57 cents. But really, it appears to be those subscribers who are the subscribers that are pushing the stock higher. AT &T added 217 million total subscribers across all divisions. That topped the street's estimate by just about 2 million. Profit and free cash flow outlook missed the street's expectations, but certainly, Dave, looks like those subscriber numbers clearly the huge headline, and that is what Wall Street is focusing on in this report.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:John Stanky ecstatic, the CEO, about those numbers, saying this marks the best 10 -quarter stretch of growth in more than a decade for AT &T, which is really a shocking number when you consider the environment that we're in at the moment. And for the exclamation point, Stanky says, what's our strategy? It's quite simple, do it again. So not a whole lot to analyze there. Pretty pleased with their performance, wants to keep it up.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:are pleased with the performance, and it looks like that strategy has been paying off. When you look at the new phone sub, 656 million. It is important to point out that they are on the rise, offering still some promotions here. That, of course, weighing on their business a bit. They're spending on that 5G expansion. They're spending on the phone giveaways to bring in those new users. That is costing AT &T just a bit, but clearly, subscribers, they are moving towards AT &T. We're seeing that reflected in those numbers. And that, friends, is what's moving the markets today.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:get you up to speed on this afternoon's market action because as you can see we are well off the lows of the day. The Dow was off over 400 points off 460 points earlier in today's trading action just a couple of hours after that opening bell. You can see we are just below the flat line off just about seven points right now. S &P also well off the lows of the day now off just about a tenth of a percent. The Nasdaq composite a lot of those larger cap tech names are under pressure earlier in earlier trading that was causing some of the losses that we were seeing across the board but the Nasdaq composite now only off about a quarter of a percent. So recouping some of those earlier losses taking a look at the bond market very quickly you see the 10 year yield off just a fraction here still just around 346 taking into some of those individual movers and starting inside the Dow you're looking at Microsoft off just about two tenths of a percent. I'll talk a little bit more about that drop that we're seeing more broadly speaking in tech but I want to also want to bring to your attention the gains that we are seeing in Boeing. Boeing reported before the bell this morning despite that miss on both the top and bottom lines. You're looking at Boeing back in the green in today's trading action trading up just about one percent. Taking a look at some of the bank stocks here the outperformer Capital One they reported after the bell yesterday. You can see it up just over nine percent today leading the way. Lots of green on the screen. We're taking a look at the XLF the financial sector here some of those larger banks. Capital One the leader here when we take a look at the S &P the top performing stock in the S &P today taking a look at that sector action there I mentioned banks leading the way with financials up just around seven tenths of a percent consumer discretionary also holding on to gains on the flip side you can see utilities by far the underperformer off just over one and a half percent XLI also off just about four tenths of a percent real quick taking a look at some of those tech names Microsoft the drop there a lot of that having to do with the guidance that initially spooked the street. You can see some of those larger tech names still under pressure today Dave we look more looking at Alphabet off just about two and a half percent Apple also in the red today.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:think what we learned over the last 24 hours is we rush to judgment with these earnings were so in a hurry to break them down and analyze them. We need to give it some time and that's a warning for Tesla because that comes out after hours. We will see a jump to conclusion.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00:and and also just how important the earnings calls are too. Yes. Two things so much stuff that goes on in the earnings calls when we hear from executives that really moves the stock the next day or during the trading day at their patients my\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:Two thingsmy friend.\n",
      "eKcNe5oe_ag.mp4\n",

      "SPEAKER_00:get you up to speed now on Big Tech. Shauna talked a lot about it there, what a difference a day makes for Microsoft. The stock down after it was, well, well up earlier in the day, but that was not the case when they released earnings Tuesday after the bell. That's when the stock rose 5 % after hours initially after everyone jumped. At what looked like a pretty solid report, RBC analyst Rishi Jaloria telling us at the time the numbers were quote, better than feared. Then came the call and a look under the hood at Microsoft, revenue growth slowing to a six year low. CEO Satya Nadella saying on the call, organizations are exercising caution given the macro economic uncertainty. We got further guidance from their CFO, Amy Hood, who said results weakened through December and should further slow in coming months. Again, kind of a lesson to wait for that call. We will certainly analyze Tesla the second they come out and do our best, but you need to give it some time and you need to hear that call before you truly analyze what it means for the next step, the next quarter, the next year.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01:exactly, or also what it could mean for some of its competitors out there. Because initially after Microsoft released earnings yesterday, when there was a lot of excitement about those numbers, particularly what we saw from the Azure, from their cloud division, that actually sparked a bit of a rally in Amazon shares and extended target muscles and concerns about how the market could leaned in terms of using those Koh - I mentioned a little bit about this building ever since this trading yesterday. Of course, the reverse happened today with Amazon under pressure, as well as a lot of the larger tech names or names focused on the cloud. Because of that guidance number. what we got from Microsoft in the earnings call. Despite all this, despite the concern that we are seeing on the street, despite the fact that we're looking at some losses today, although you can see we're well off the lows of the day when you're taking a look at some of those larger tech names, the street remains positive on Microsoft City, reiterating once again that Microsoft is, quote, best positioned among large -cap software names, offering investors a good mix of growth and profitability. We also have Morgan Stanley maintaining that overweight rating there. All right, Microsoft pulling the rest of the market down with it. You can see the Dow still in negative territory, though,off the lows of the day. Look at a two -day chart there on an intraday basis. We are now actually in positive territory in the final hour trading, up just about 17 points.\n"
